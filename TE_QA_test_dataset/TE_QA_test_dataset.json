During the first cycle, the temperature dependence of the Seebeck shows a maximum (about 280 μV/K) at 400 K, followed by a continuous decrease. During the second and third cycles, the maximum at about 400 K progressively decreases to ∼200 μV/K and 150 μV/K, respectively, and it is followed by a continuous increase with temperature. During the fourth and fifth cycles, the maximum at 400 K disappears and the Seebeck coefficient shows a reproducible continuous increase with temperature. As shown by XRD analysis, and , and SEM observations, , the as prepared ODP – RS sample contains ZnSb as well as Zn. In multiphase systems, the Seebeck coefficient depends on the thermopower behaviour of the single phases. The Seebeck coefficient of ZnSb ranges from 200 μV/K to 400 μV/K at room temperature, and its temperature dependence shows a maximum value between 400 K and 500 K . In the case of Zn4Sb3, α is around 100 μV/K at room temperature and shows a continuous increase with temperature . Thus, in the as prepared ODP – RS sample, the presence of ZnSb is responsible for the enhanced values of α at room temperature with respect to Zn4Sb3 single phase, and for the maximum around 400 K. As the sample is progressively homogenized by thermal cycling, the values and the temperature dependence of α tend to become those expected for Zn4Sb3 single phase. Both the disappearance of the endothermic peaks in DSC traces between the fourth and the fifth cycles, due to consumption of Zn by reaction (3), and the appearance of a reproducible temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient between the fourth and fifth cycles can be correlated to the sample homogenization. A similar behaviour is also observed for the ODP – MA sample (not shown). In this case, seven thermal cycles are needed before observing thermopower reproducibility, because of the larger amount of ZnSb and Zn in ODP – MA sample with respect to ODP – RS sample.",

In their crystalline bulk form these alloys possess a power factor similar to that of Si (S2σ = 40–50 µW/K·cm) but a reduced κ due to the alloy-induced scattering of high frequency phonons (down to κ = 4 W/m·K for a highly doped n-type Si0.7Ge0.3 alloy with respect to 150 W/m·K for pure Si) achieving a maximum ZT of 1 at 1100 K . Further κ reduction can be attained by nanostructuring, which yields to enhanced phonon boundary scattering effect in nanowires, thin films, superlattices and finely-grained bulk with characteristic sizes below ~ 100 nm . Boundary scattering mostly affects phonons of intermediate frequencies, leading to a drastically reduced thermal conductivity ruled by a rather small population of low frequency phonons impervious to this mechanism . The reduction of κ by means of alloying and nanostructuring is attained without prejudice of S and σ, leading to an overall increase in ZT, as demonstrated for many thermoelectric materials including Si and SiGe nanowires and other structures . This fact is explained by the comparatively shorter mean free path of electrons with respect to that of phonons in doped semiconductors, which is not reduced in a large proportion when boundary and point-defect (i.e. alloying) disruptions of lattice periodicity are introduced. In the case of SiGe nanowires (NWs) a minimum κ of 1–2 W/m·K and a maximum ZT of 0.46 at 450 K (two times that of similar composition bulk alloy) were reported . Since alloying significantly increases the raw material cost (Ge 900 $/kg vs. Si 1 $/kg), nanostructuring can be regarded as an approach to reduce the amount of Ge needed to yield the targeted ZT (e.g. from 20% to 5% for a ZT of 0.9 as in ), as well as increasing the power per unit mass .",

The power factor is an important in characterizing the thermoelectric potential as it appears in numerator of ZT and independent of total thermal conductivity. The power factor can be further enhanced without considering the effect of total thermal conductivity. At 290 K, the value of power factor for Ca3SnO is 160 μWm−1 K−2 while for Ca3PbO is 94 μWm−1 K−2. The greater value of power for Ca3SnO over the whole range of temperature, reveals Ca3SnO to be better thermoelectric material than Ca3PbO over the wide range of temperature which is compatible to experimental results [].",

For Mn1.03Bi4S7, σ declines from about 7.25 × 10^3 S m−1 at 300 K to 1.58 × 10^3 at 770 K while the value of σ near 300 K increases dramatically to 1.73 × 10^4 S m−1 for S-deficient MnBi4S6.86 sample, which should be ascribed to the enlarged carrier concentration in this sample, which is confirmed by the results of Hall carrier concentration measurement listed in ",

Specifically, the Seebeck coefficient of Cu2Sn0.93Ag0.07Se3 reaches +145 μVK−1 at 773 K, which is 15 μVK−1 larger than the linear extrapolating value (shown as the red dashed line). d illustrates that the PFs of all doped samples are enhanced owing to the optimized carrier concentrations. Moreover, benefitting from the increased carrier concentrations and the sharp increase of Seebeck coefficients at elevated temperatures, the PFs for 5%, 7%, and 9% Ag-doped samples are improved continuously across the whole temperature range. A record high PF of 12.9 μWcm−1K−2 is achieved in Cu2Sn0.93Ag0.07Se3 at 773 K, which increases significantly by ∼220% from that of the undoped Cu2SnSe3.",

Strontium titanate (STO) is a leading candidate and the undoped material has a large Seebeck coefficient ∼ 850 μVK−1, but low electrical conductivity and high thermal conductivity. There have been many approaches to improve the properties of SrTiO3. A single crystal of La doped SrTiO3 has been reported to have a similar power factor (S2σ) to that of Bi2Te3 at room temperature (2800–3600 μW/K2m) . However the high thermal conductivity of undoped SrTiO3, in the range 6–12 W/mK, from room temperature to 1000 K , remains an important factor limiting the improvement of overall ZT. The thermoelectric performance of the STO based ceramics has been addressed by simultaneously improving the power factor and introducing phonon scattering centres to reduce the thermal conductivity. The difficulty in this approach is further accentuated by the increased electronic component of thermal conductivity as the electrical resistivity is reduced (parameters being linked by the Wiedmann-Franz law ). Dehkordi et al. have shown significant improvement in power factor of STO by using Pr doping and optimizing the presence of Pr-rich inclusions at grain boundaries using non-equilibrium heating rates. The main factors that improve the properties are the influence of donor-type oxygen vacancies in bulk compositions and of cationic substitution. Doped SrTiO3 prepared under reducing conditions has been particularly promising with ZT values as large as 0.41 at 1073 K being obtained . Other work has demonstrated that A and B site doping and variation of processing conditions can enhance the thermoelectric properties of these perovskites . Co-doping on the A/B sites and doping with heavy elements (in particular Dy and W ) have been effective in reducing thermal conductivity by phonon scattering. In addition, the generation of oxygen vacancies, by processing the materials under reducing conditions, has been equally beneficial for STO, leading to the creation of additional charge carriers as the oxidation states of transition elements (particularly Ti/Nb) are adjusted . The control of A-site cationic vacancies is also gaining attention as a route to improve thermoelectric properties. Popuri et al. have demonstrated temperature independent thermal conductivity for STO where 27% A-sites are vacant. Related work has explored the effect of A-site vacancies generated by a range of co-dopants . Notably, Lu et al. also investigated vacancy ordering as",

In comparison with the control samples, the Fe/Cu-containing samples exhibited a marked 50% improvement in ZT. The small increase in thermal conductivity brought about by the presence of the inclusions was not sufficient to reduce the power factor to any degree. Indeed, the effect of reduced electrical resistivity dominated, enabling improved power factor and hence, ZT in samples containing metal inclusions. At temperatures up to 900 K the figure of merit for the Cu-containing samples was higher than for other samples, with a maximum ZT of 0.36. The Fe-containing samples displayed an almost linear dependence of ZT with temperature, with a highest ZT of 0.38 at 1000 K. These values show considerable improvement in the figure of merit compared to control sample and verifies the benefit of employing small metallic inclusions in perovskite thermoelectric ceramics. Once realistic uncertainties in ZT are taken into account (at least ±10%) the highest values here (0.38) are comparable with many of the best values reported for SrTiO3-based ceramics using alternative approaches. For example, Lin et al. achieved a ZT of 0.38 at 1000 K for La doped STO assisted with inclusion of graphene. Zhang et al. reported a ZT of 0.37 at 1000 K for SrTi0.85Nb0.15O3 and Lu et al. obtained a ZT of 0.40 for A-site deficient La doped STO (La0.2Sr0.7TiO3); Dy doping of STO yielded a ZT of 0.41 at 1073 K . Again all these values are within the same significance bands. It is interesting to note that while the ZT values for the ceramics are lower than those for the single crystal data at low temperatures, the ZT values for the ceramics are consistently higher at the higher temperatures.",

All the samples indicate positive Seebeck coefficient, implying that the electrical transport properties are dominated by holes. With the increasing Sr doping content, the Seebeck coefficient decreases over the whole temperature region due to the introduction of holes. The Seebeck coefficient of CeZnSbO (129 μV/K at 330 K) is generally smaller than that of BiCuSeO (350 μV/K at 293 K), and the electrical conductivity of CeZnSbO (1300 S m−1 at 330 K) is much larger compared to that of BiCuSeO (470 S m−1 at 293 K) . This is an indication that the band gap of pristine CeZnSbO should be much smaller than that of pristine BiCuSeO. The thermoelectric power factor (PF) of Ce1−xSrxZnSbO samples were calculated and shown in ",

The highest power factor of about 470 μWm−1K−2 is achieved in Na0.02Sn0.98Se at 798 K, comparable to the best values achieved in p-doped polycrystalline SnSe synthesized under ambient pressure . In addition, the power factor of our high pressure synthesized Na0.02Sn0.98Se maintains a relatively high value (>300 μWm−1K−2) when temperature is higher than 500 K, which is beneficial to the overall thermoelectric performance of SnSe.",

The composition-induced structural phase transition could be realized by varying the compositions in these alloys, which may largely alter the electronic structure and phonon dispersion. Among them, the Se-alloyed Sb2Te3 accompanied with structural transition is seldom reported. Herein, the interrelations of Se-alloying induced changes in structural phase transition, band structure and TE properties of p-type zone-melted Sb2Te3-xSex (x = 1.5–2.4) alloys near phase transition boundary are systematically investigated. The results demonstrate that Sb2Te3-xSex shows a structural transition from a rhombohedral phase to mixed structure at x = 2.0. The carrier concentration and bandgap at room temperature of Sb2Te3-xSex (x = 1.5–2.4) constantly decrease with increasing Se contents x. The zT peak of the Sb2TeSe2 matrix is improved and shifted to higher temperature by optimizing carrier concentration via Ag doping. A maximum zT of ∼0.4 is obtained at 680 K in Sb1.97Ag0.03TeSe2 alloy, about 100% enhancement compared with the undoped sample.",

The traditional strategy for boosting ZT of β-Zn4Sb3 is to adjust the carrier concentration and lower thermal conductivity simultaneously by doping. For instance, dopants such as Pb, Bi, Mg, Cu, Sn, In, Cd, Al, Ga, Nb, Hg, Co, Te, I, Se, Fe and Ag have been investigated so far []. However, the results showed that although the individual parameters were affected by doping, there was a little or no overall improvement of its thermoelectric performance. The main reasons lie in the following factors: (i) thermal conductivity of β-Zn4Sb3 is very low (<1 W m−1K−1) [,,] which is close to the practical lower limit for the thermal conductivity in solids []; this means that there is no much room in lowering its thermal conductivity; (ii) the hole concentration of pristine β-Zn4Sb3 is in the order of 10^24∼10^25 m−3 [,,], which indicates that its carrier concentration has already been close to the optimum. These characters of β-Zn4Sb3 mentioned here suggest that it is difficult to enhance its thermoelectric performance remarkably through doping, unless the Seebeck coefficient S can be extra elevated upon doping. This is extremely important to the material system since the Seebeck coefficient of β-Zn4Sb3 is relatively small (around 100 μV/K at room temperature [,,,,]), and only when large S is achieved can the thermoelectric performance of β-Zn4Sb3 be improved substantially.",

                    "context": "The electrocrystallization of p-type Bi-Sb-Te and n-type Bi-Te-Se thermoelectric (TE) compounds in chloride baths was detailed in this study. Based on the cyclic voltammetry (CV) results, target p-type films can be electroplated using pulsed electrodeposition and the n-type films can be electroplated via potentiostatic electrodeposition. The n-type film shows a compact structure throughout the course of electrodeposition. The resulting 27-μm-thick Bi1.88Te2.70Se0.42 film has a Seebeck coefficient of −50 μV/K and a power factor of 130 μW/m·K2 at room temperature. Conversely, nodular and dendritic p-type grains develop on top of a compact under layer as the electrodeposition proceeds. This development is accompanied by the disappearance of the nucleation loop in CV. Moreover, the presence of a distinct Te-rich layer was observed at the p-type film/substrate interface. The loose structure associated with nodular and dendritic p-type grains results in increased resistance and decreased power factor, but slightly influences the Seebeck coefficient. The p-type Bi0.45Sb1.22Te3.33 film with optimal thermoelectric properties is obtained via pulsed deposition with a thickness of around 2 μm and has a Seebeck coefficient of +150 μV/K and a power factor of 150 μW/m·K2 at room temperature. Finally, the electric resistance and uncompensated ohmic drop need to be considered for the electrodeposition of a compact p-type Bi-Sb-Te film with optimal TE properties.",

Cu2SnSe3 is a p-type semiconductor with a narrow gap and can crystallize into a cubic (F-43 m) or monoclinic (Cc) phase. Shi et al. [] found that the Cu-Se bonds form an electrically conductive framework, and Sn atoms reside in the framework and donate electrons to balance the structure. This is a typical PGEC structure. By In substitution for Sn, a high zT of 1.14 at 850 K was achieved. Bulk (Ag, In)-co-doped Cu2SnSe3 samples were prepared via a high pressure combustion synthesis by Li et al. [] Ag-doping at Cu site enhances the Seebeck coefficient and increases zT to 0.80 at 773 K for Cu1.85Ag0.15SnSe3. The low electrical conductivity caused by Ag-doping was repaired by In-doping at Sn site, yielding the maximum zT = 1.42 in Cu1.85Ag0.15Sn0.9In0.1Se3 at 823 K. Other ternary Cu-based selenides also exhibit decent zT values. In sections and , we will present two typical high-performance compounds: Cu3SbSe4 composed of earth-abundant and low-cost elements (), and n-type AgInSe2.",

For instance, S298 for Yb14MgSb11, Yb14MnSb11, and its doped modifications, as well as A14MgBi11 phases (A = Sr, Eu, Yb) is in the range of 20–60 μV/K [,,,]; S298 for the series Ca13RECdSb11 (RE = La–Nd, Sm) is in the range of 30–70 μV/K []. The slight increase in value of S room temperature reported for Ca14MgSb11 (125 μV/K) is offset by the increased resistivity and most likely related to the oxidation of the surface of the measured material [].",

PdCoO2 is the most conductive oxide known so far with an electrical resistivity in the ab-plane of 4.69 μΩ cm at room temperature, which is less than for pure Pd . Although delafossite-structured materials have been known for 140 years, the research interest in this type of materials has increased after the first report on the preparation of transparent p-type CuAlO2 thin films by Kawazoe and co-workers in 1997 . This opened up the possibility to use delafossites as transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), since p-type TCOs are required in many practical applications based on p-n junctions. Since then, delafossites, especially those based on Cu and Ag, have received considerable attention owing to their potential applications as e.g. p-type TCOs , photocatalysts , anode material for Li-batteries , thermoelectrical materials , and gas sensor . Recently, high temperature superconductivity was also suggested for doped members of this type of oxide compounds .",

For the optimized samples Zhang et al. and Tang et al. reported similar mobilities in Mg2(1-x)Li2xSn0.7Si0.3 and Mg2(1-x)Li2xSn0.6Si0.4, respectively. For carrier concentrations above 1 × 10^20 cm−3, where the optimized carrier concentration is expected, the mobilities for all the Li doped Mg2Sn0.75Ge0.25 are higher compared to the previous reports, which results in a peak power factor of 18 μW cm−1 K−2 at 723 K for Mg1.96Li0.04Sn0.75Ge0.25. The high power factor is partially due to the high Sn content in the samples and furthermore due to the use of Ge instead of Si. Recently, de Boor and Saparamadu et al. used the same synthesis technique to compare the properties of Li doped Mg2(Sn,Si) and Mg2(Sn,Ge) . They found the mobilities of Li doped Mg2(Sn,Ge) samples are higher compared to the Mg2(Sn,Ge) samples, in agreement with the findings for the n-type Mg2X (X = Sn, Si, Ge) .

As expected, the carrier concentration is enhanced significantly due to the acceptor role of Ni ions with the unpaired 3d electrons. DFT calculations demonstrate that the unpaired Ni 3d states contribute to the hybridization of Ni 3d orbitals with Se 4p orbitals near the Fermi level, leading to an increase of DOS. Meanwhile, the substitution of Ni for Ge causes the obvious local distortions in Cu2GeSe3 lattice, which yields the large strain fluctuations to suppress the lattice thermal conductivity. The experimental lattice thermal conductivity fits well with the calculated values according to the Callaway model as the point defect is considered. As a result, the Cu2Ge0.9Ni0.1Se3 sample possesses a remarkably high power factor of ∼7.5 μW cm−1 K−2 and a peak ZT of ∼0.38 at 723 K.",

The CaMn1 − xRuxO3 and CaMn1 − yMoyO3 systems exhibit relative low resistivities (ρ < 0.03 Ω cm) and moderate absolute thermopower values at room temperature (Seebeck coefficient S > 100 μV/K) . In a CaMn1 − xNbxO3 system, it is found that the manganite phases exhibit a structural transition from orthorhombic to cubic symmetry at high temperatures . This transition in structure resulted in obvious changes in the electrical and thermal transport properties. And the “chimie douce” (SC) synthesis is also applied to improve the thermoelectric properties of CaMn1 − xNbxO3 compounds . Thermal conductivity values were achieved for the SC-derived phases (κ < 1 W m−1 K−1). The low thermal conductivity combined with high the power factors resulted in a zT value of 0.32.",

As the doping amount increases, both the carrier concentration and the electrical conductivity decrease. As a function of temperature, the electrical conductivity decreases, displaying a metallic nature of conduction. Although the carrier mobility distinctly increases upon doping with Cu or Ag, the conductivity decreases because the reduced carrier concentration plays a more prominent role. The carrier concentration in the Ag-doped specimens is slightly lower than in the Cu-doped specimens for the same nominal doping content. This is because the actually accommodated amount of Ag in the type-III clathrate matrix phase is slightly higher than that of Cu. As the data in (c) indicate, the Seebeck coefficient is negative and in accord with the negative Hall coefficient. The single-phase Ba24Ge100 compound has the Seebeck coefficient of about −20 μV/K at room temperature and approximately −51 μV/K at 873 K. As the Cu and Ag doping content increases, the absolute value of the Seebeck coefficient increases. The magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient of Ba24Cu6Ge94 is 80.5 μV/K at 873 K while Ba24Ag6Ge94 has reached its maximum value of the Seebeck coefficient of 87 μV/K at 820 K, both Cu and Ag doped structures significantly exceeding the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient of the undoped sample.",

                    "context": ", the results from the Seebeck coefficient measurements are shown. a represents the Seebeck coefficients for the TiO2 nanotubes without Te–Bi–Pb nanoparticles, while b stands for the results of the TiO2 nanotube specimens with Te–Bi–Pb nanoparticles. The results evidently show that the TiO2 nanotubes with scattered Te–Bi–Pb nanoparticles have the Seebeck coefficient two times higher than that of the specimens without nanoparticles measuring in the temperature range from 30 °C to 200 °C. The highest Seebeck coefficient is 90 μV/K at 40 °C for pure TiO2 nanotubes. And for TiO2 nanotubes with Te–Bi–Pb nanoparticles, the highest Seebeck coefficient reaches 155 μV/K at 70 °C. The results show that the TiO2 nanotubes are n-type semiconductors. The Seebeck coefficients increase to peak values and then decrease for TiO2 nanotubes with or without nanoparticles. The lowest Seebeck coefficient is 17 μV/K at 200 °C for pure TiO2 nanotubes and 50 μV/K at 200 °C for TiO2 nanotubes with scattered Te–Bi–Pb nanoparticles which is nearly two times higher than that of the specimens without nanoparticles. This could be explained by quantum confinement effect. When the Te–Bi–Pb nanoparticles are small enough, the electrons and/or holes can be squeezed into a small domain approaching the Bohr radius. The energy spectrum turns to be discrete, leading to the size-dependent bandgap instead of continuous bandgap in a bulk material. This effect can result in different properties for nanostructured materials compared with conventional materials. Specifically, the bandgap is greater for nanoparticles than the corresponding bulk materials. As a result, the electron density is higher in the nanostructures of TiO2 nanotube supported Te–Bi–Pb nanoparticles. This might account for the result that the Seebeck coefficient of the TiO2 nanotubes with scattered Te–Bi–Pb nanoparticles is much higher than that of the pure TiO2 nanotubes.",

For oxides of Rh4+ the 4d t2g band is 83% filled, and electrical conductivity measurements indicate itinerant electron behavior in RhO2, SrRhO3, Sr4Rh3O10, Sr3Rh2O7, and Sr2RhO4. One might then expect that (Bi6O5)Rh12O24 could be metallic with a 95% filled 4d t2g band. Although (Bi6O5)Rh12O24 is a good electrical conductor, its conductivity is actually several orders of magnitude less than expected for a metal. Furthermore, its temperature dependence of conductivity is the opposite expected for a metal, and the high Seebeck coefficient is typical of a semiconductor rather than a metal. Finally, our magnetic susceptibility measurements show the presence of a localized moment. A similar temperature dependence of conductivity with a room temperature of 67 S/cm was observed for Ba1.21Bi0.33Rh8O16 with the Hollandite structure . A room temperature conductivity of 0.1 S/cm was found for crystals of p-type LuRhO3, and a room temperature conductivity of 0.7 S/cm was found for films of p-type ZnRh2O4. Because both of these materials were p-type, they may be regarded as a Rh3+/Rh4+ mixed-valent compounds containing only a small amount of Rh4+.",

The cation substitution content affected the crystalline phase and the thermoelectric properties of CuMn1.1−xExO2 (E=Mg, Ca, Sr, x=0–0.2) bulks. Bulks with the CuMnO2 phase were obtained for all samples. Increasing the amount of dopants, which were Mg, Ca and Sr, caused an expansion in unit cell volume, increase in electrical conductivity and decrease in thermal conductivity. The ionic radius of Mg is smaller than those of the other dopants, and thus it can substitute for Mn more readily. This phenomenon made the unit cell volume and electrical conductivity with Mg substitution were both higher than seen with the other dopant samples, while the thermal conductivity was lower. While the substitution effect could enhance carrier concentration, the Seebeck coefficient was inversely proportional to the carrier concentration, and this caused a fall in the absolute value of the Seebeck coefficient for all bulks. The highest electrical conductivity (0.24 S/cm) and Seebeck coefficient (485 μV/K) at room temperature were obtained from the CuMn0.9Mg0.2O2 and CuMn0.975Ca0.025O2 bulks, respectively. The κl was the major contribution to the thermal conductivity, which implies that phonon–phonon scattering had the main effect on κ for the CuMn1.1−xExO2 (E=Mg, Ca, Sr, x=0–0.2) samples. The CuMn0.9Mg0.2O2 sample had the lowest thermal conductivity (2 W m−1\nK−1) and highest power factor (3.95×10−3\nmW m−1\nK−2), which led to a dimensionless figure of merit of 0.00059 at room temperature.",

For PN1, there was a weak correlation between the Seebeck coefficient and the nanoheater generating the temperature gradient due to the symmetric configuration. On the other hand, the Seebeck coefficient of PN2 varied significantly depending upon which nanoheater was used. This was attributed to the highly asymmetric configuration of PN2. (b) shows that, after temperature correction with the simulation results, the ΔV/ΔT values nearly converged, thus validating the temperature-correction scheme.

This is a result of the diminishing contribution of the charge carrier component (C). The trend reverses for the lattice contribution to the total thermal conductivity, such that the most complex structure, pristine orthorhombic Ba8Cu16P30, exhibits the lowest lattice thermal conductivity; the less complex tetragonal Ba6.4La1.6Cu16P30 with smaller cages and less space for guest rattling possesses higher lattice thermal conductivity. Nonetheless, the total and lattice thermal conductivities for all the clathrates studied are very low and comparable with those for state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials. Rare-earth incorporation leads to enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient and suppression of the total thermal conductivity, resulting in a significant improvement of the thermoelectric figure of merit, zT = S2T/ρκ, where S is the thermopower, T is the absolute temperature, ρ is the electrical resistivity, and κ is the total thermal conductivity. Ba6.4La1.6Cu16P30 shows the highest efficiency, 0.11 at 300 K to 0.63 at 900 K, compared with the poor efficiency of Ba8Cu16P30, 0.01 at 300 K to 0.09 at 900 K; 700% enhancement of thermoelectric efficiency due to rare-earth doping is a substantial achievement compared with incremental 20%–40% increases that are typical in the thermoelectric field. Moreover, the flexible Cu–P clathrate framework provides room for further improvement of the thermoelectric efficiency.",

A Ca2.7Ag0.3Co4O9/Ag-10 wt% composite showed an enhanced ZT of 0.5 at 1000 K. Bismuth (Bi) doping has also resulted in enhanced TPFs and reduced κ. However, the ZT of Bi-doped samples, is not as high as those of Ag doped oxides. Ca2.75Gd0.25Co4O9 ceramics have also been shown to exhibit TPF and ZT of 480 μW/m K2 and 0.23 respectively, at 923 K (c) . It is seen that the Ca2.75Gd0.25Co4O9 ceramics synthesised using the SPS method exhibit slightly higher TPFs and ZTs compared to hot press (HP) synthesised samples (c). There are also reports on the doping of Ca3Co4O9 with transition metals such as copper and nickel. Gallium addition has been demonstrated to improve TPFs and ZTs . Doping with lanthanum and lanthanide elements has also been studied but the TE enhancements have not been as impressive .",

At room temperature, the electrical conductivity of the Sr substituted samples increases slightly with the increasing Sr content because the Sr ion is larger in diameter than Ca ion. However, the electrical conductivity of Ca3Co4O9+δ is higher than all the Sr containing samples. The pellet of Ca3Co4O9+δ is sintered at 1100°C, but those of Sr substituted samples are sintered at 920°C. The higher electrical conductivity of Ca3Co4O9+δ is perhaps related to its lower intergrain resistivity of the pellet for measurement. The electrical conductivity of Ca3Co4O9+δ increases slightly with increasing temperature, and the value is 83.4 S cm−1 at 700°C. A transition of the conducting type from semiconductor to metal was observed above 700 K for the Sr substituted samples with x=0.5 and 1.0. Similar behavior has been reported for other oxides with perovskite type structure, such as Ln2SrCo2O7 and La1−xSrxCoO3.",

The negative sign of Seebeck coefficient for all samples over the measured temperature range indicates that predominant charge carriers for the thermoelectric transport are electrons. However, the large magnitude and non-linear temperature variation of S(T) observed in the stoichiometric compound SrAl2Si2 is strikingly different from the Y substituted alloys. The T-dependent S in SrAl2Si2 exhibits a broad minimum with an absolute value of about 100 μV/K near 130 K, and then attains a positive slope at high temperatures. The upturn of S in SrAl2Si2 at high temperatures is attributed to the contribution of thermally excited positive carriers across the pseudogap . The change in the slope for S at around 130 K suggests the existence of lighter electron and heavier hole pockets in the band structure of SrAl2Si2. However, the electrons become heavier and thus dominate the S(T) below about 100 K. Such a scenario appears to be consistent with our band structure calculations of SrAl2Si2, where the Fermi surface consists of one electron pockets centered at the M point and two hole pockets centered at the Γ point. Within the two-band model, it allows us to consider a contribution from a semiconducting like holes in addition to a metallic term as a possible explanation for the observed exotic thermoelectric transport behavior in SrAl2Si2. It should be pointed out that these interpretations are consistent with the observations in the isostructural compound CaAl2Si2 and the high-temperature result obtained from a single crystal of Sr2Al2Si2.",

The highest value of the figure of merit, ∼0.4, was obtained at 375–400 K for the sample Bi1.99Cr0.01Te3. Although lower zT are generally obtained for n-type Bi2Te3 compared to p-type Bi2Te3, the low thermoelectric efficiency of our samples is associated with the lack of carrier concentration optimization. We also purposely sintered at the lowest SPS temperature which provided us with samples with relative density of over 98%. Sintering at high temperatures can result in inhomogeneity of Bi2Te3 samples in terms of composition and introduces defects which both effect on the electronic transport properties, and may lead to one-off high zT, but which may also not be stable in long-term applications at high temperatures. The highest zT values for n-type Bi2Te3-based compounds (∼1) are achieved in nanostructured Bi2Te3–Bi2Se3 alloys at optimised carrier concentrations, doped with Cu, which is also an element with magnetic moment. The aim of this study was to decouple the effect of magnetism and the carrier concentration–related effect to prove the importance of magnetism on thermoelectricity; this was not viable to achieve in complex chemistries, and therefore, we demonstrated the magnetic enhancement effect in this way. Nevertheless, with x = 0.01, the figure of merit shows an increase of roughly 25% compared to the undoped compound, at constant carrier concentration. The magnetic doping, leading to magnetic interaction with the carriers driving the increased S and leading to decreased κlatt, due to the point defect scattering, results in the observed enhancement in zT. For the other compounds, the slight variations of n and the loss of the magnetic coupling of the carriers due to intercalation of the Cr ions prevent samples to achieve higher values of zT.",

By means of spin- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy we demonstrate the separation of the Dirac point from the bulk states and the helical spin structure of the Dirac cone. For the freshly cleaved surface the Fermi level is located in the bulk band gap and an exposure in residual gases shifts the Fermi level towards the bulk conduction band. Results of the theoretical calculations are in a good agreement with the experimental data. Surface morphology study shows a well-structured atomically sharp surface after cleavage. The transport measurements confirm that this topological insulator has relatively high resistance with semiconductor-like temperature dependence at low temperatures. The studied Bi1.5Sb0.5Te1.8Se1.2 crystals demonstrated a quite large Seebeck coefficient values reaching −400 μV/K at room temperature.",

However, all the doped samples behave like degenerate semiconductor as the σ decreases with temperature due to enhanced impurity scattering of charge carriers resulting a fall in the σ with the rising temperature. This slight degenerate semiconducting nature has also been confirmed by the calculations of room temperature fermi energy as explained earlier. Among all the synthesized samples, the sample with composition Fe0.25Co0.75Sb2.99Bi0.01 turn out to be the most electrically conducting with RT σ ~10 × 10^4 S/m which is higher than the previously reported values for similarly co-doped CoSb3 []. At elevated temperature, the σ of the corresponding sample reduced to ~9 × 10^4 S/m due to boost in charge carriers scattering. displays the theoretically calculated temperature dependent σ for Fe and Bi co-doped CoSb3 with different values of n, which suggest that the σ decreases with temperature confirming the degenerate semiconducting nature, similar to that observed experimentally. Also, these values are in reasonable agreement with the experimentally measured values of σ. Further, It is also evident from , that expectedly S decreases while σ increases with increasing n, following the mathematical relation between n and the transport properties [].",

                    "context": "These results from the literature emphasize the need for sufficient power output in these types of devices. The ZT value of materials used and structure of the devices significantly affect the output power and voltage. For example, Hyland, et al. reported the effect of heat spreader material, heat spreader size, and sandwich device structure, etc. on the output powers of the flexible TEG fabricated by 25 pairs of p-type and n-type bismuth telluride. The flexible TEG was applied on the wrist, upper arm, chest, and T-shirt, respectively, and the highest output power ∼20 μW/cm2 was obtained when applied on the upper arm with air speed at about 1.4 m/s. They also found that it is more convenient to wear when the TEG was suspended on the T-shirt, but in this case the output power is the least when compared to the TEG applied on different locations on a human body. The ZT value of the screen-printed Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 films can be almost doubled up to 0.90 at room temperature via a post ionized defect engineering method by reducing the bismuth oxide particles in the as-prepared films. This value is almost as high as the bulk Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 materials. With 72 TE pairs a flexible generator of size 40 mm × 40 mm × 0.8 mm fabricated by p-type Bi0.5Sb1.5Se0.3 and treated n-type Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 is reported to generate an open-circle voltage 693 mV, and a power density 6.32 mW/cm2 at a temperature difference of 25.6 K . Most recently, Kim et al. fabricated a flexible TEG with p- and n-type Bi-Te based alloy legs (1.0 mm × 2.5 mm) on the patterned copper thin film, and then filled the empty space in the TEG with a proprietary polymer material, as a result, a power density of 2.28 μW/cm2 was achieved.",

First of all, it is clearly seen that our theoretical κbp+κph -T findings are in a fairly good agreement with the work of Khan et al. . We want to primarily notice that for all Bi doping levels the bipolar contribution on thermal conduction starts to exhibit its visible effect nearly above 700 K and leads a very slight increment in κbp+κph. Among all samples, from experimental findings it was reported that the z=0.025 sample has slightly sharper increase in κbp+κph above 700 K. This can be explained by using the highest Fbp parameter in our computations for z=0.025 sample as can be seen in . To obtain more detailed information about the temperature dependent phonon thermal conductivity the effect of different phonon scattering mechanisms on κph is displayed for only z=0.02 sample in (b). We found that boundary scattering plays a major role on κph below 100 K therefore its visible effect can not be seen in studied temperature range. Additionally, contributions from anharmonic and acoustic deformation potential scattering processes play a substantial role temperatures from 300 K to 850 K. However, more importantly, the mass defect scattering mechanism presents a dominant contribution for κph among all other scattering processes. Now, we can go back to (a) and report that while the Bi doping level increases the value of κbp+κph becomes larger which can be explained with increasing mass defect parameter Γmd. Furthermore, the smallest value of κbp+κph is attained both theoretically and experimentally for z=0.02 sample throughout the temperature range with the help of its larger mass defect scattering mechanism. While Khan et al. obtained the (κbp+κph)min as 1.01 W/m.K at 755 K we found (κbp+κph)min as 0.99 W/m.K at 850 K. Binary undoped Mg2Si has very large phonon thermal conductivity ( 11 W m−1 K−1) at room temperature . This value was decreased to 1.9 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K by using Mg2Si0.55Sn0.4Ge0.05 solid solution by Vlachos et al. due to the incorporation of mass fluctuation via Si/Sn/Ge substitution. To achieve further decrease in phonon thermal conductivity the way of doping is tried for these quaternary systems since introducing additional atoms in lattice leads a significant increment of complexity in the systems’ structure. For an effective n-type doping Bi is the best choice for Mg2(SiGeSn) systems because Bi atom",

TEG is an encouraging and effective technology for power generation and cooling. Thermoelectric materials are used to convert heat to electricity and vice-versa. The coefficient of performance of a potential thermoelectric material is determined by the dimensionless figure of merit, ZT=S2σTk, where S, σ, k=ke+kl and T are the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity (consisting of electronic and lattice thermal conductivity) and absolute temperature, respectively. The half-heusler 18-electron ABX compounds have attracted much attention due to their semiconducting behavior and high thermoelectric performance . Recently, researchers reported some previously unknown Half-Heusler compounds, such as ScPtBi, TiPdSn, ZrNbPb, etc. and it is found that ZrNiPb based half-heusler materials can exhibit high thermoelectric performance (ZT ∼ 0.8 at 800 K) . Although the pure ZrNiPb has low thermoelectric performance, the doping of suitable element (Sn, Bi) significantly increases the ZT of ZrNiPb . Recently, Zakutayev et al. reported the experimental synthesis of TaCoSn, an 18-electron ABX half-heusler compound . This material was reported to be semiconductor and possibility of high thermoelectric performance . Bhattacharya et al. calculated the optimal zT0 (not usual ZT) of TaCoSn by assuming the lattice part of thermal conductivity κph/τ ∼ 1014 W/mKs and found to be 1.73 . This indicates the possibility of high thermoelectric performance. Therefore, it is reasonable to study the lattice thermal conductivity and details of transport properties along with the electronic nature of TaCoSn.",

We have calculated elastic constants and moduli of elasticity, anisotropy, Vickers hardness. We also calculate the Debye temperature of TaCoSn which found to be 375.39 K. The calculated band structure of TaCoSn confirms the semiconducting nature and the possibility of high thermoelectric performance. The relaxation time and lattice thermal conductivity have been calculated for TaCoSn. The maximum Seebeck coefficient is obtained at 500 K, 249.41 μV/K and power factor (S2σ) of TaCoSn is 2.22 × 10^12 W/msK2 at 1000 K. The calculated maximum thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) is found to be 0.731 at 600 K indicating that TaCoSn is a high performance thermoelectric material.",

As can be seen, κ of the pristine BST decreases firstly to the lowest value of 1.14 Wm−1K−1 at 323 K, and then increases to 1.82 Wm−1 K−1 with increasing the temperature, while κ of 0.22wt.%Cu/BST decreases from 1.75 to 1.37 Wm−1 K−1 at the same temperature range. The annealed BST and annealed 0.22wt.%Cu/BST have the same decreasing trend of κ. The annealed 0.22wt.%Cu/BST has a κ of 0.4 Wm−1K−1, which is lower than that of BST and 0.22wt.%Cu/BST. The κe is well described by the Wiedemann–Franz’s law , κe = LσT, where L is the Lorenz number, estimated using a single parabolic band (SPB) model with acoustic phonon scattering, shown in (e). As can be seen, κe of 0.22wt.%Cu/BST and annealed 0.22wt.%Cu/BST enhances due to the great increase of σ. The κl is further calculated by subtracting the κe from the κ, as shown in (f). From which, κl in 0.22wt.%Cu/BST and annealed 0.22wt.%Cu/BST are remarkably declined, and the lowest κl is 0.30 Wm−1K−1 at 321 K for annealed 0.22wt.%Cu/BST, approaching the extreme limited value in BST .",

The metallic conduction behavior and decrease in electrical resistivity is believed to result from the excess metal Zn in the Zn4(Sb1−xTex)3 structure. Sb in Zn4Sb3 presents two kinds of state - Sb3− and Sb24- dimmers . Since ionic radius of Te− (2.50 Å) are similar to that of Sb3− (2.45 Å), Te doping in Zn4Sb3 presents a valence state of Te−. So, if the substitution of Te for Sb happens, only a composition of Zn3.95(Sb0.98Te0.02)3 can maintain a charge balance. The room temperature Hall coefficient for metal Zn is +0.33 × 10−4 cm3/C, which means the excess Zn in our Te-doped sample will supply holes. Carrier concentration of metal Zn is 1.89 × 10^23/cm3. This is larger than that of β-Zn4Sb3 (9 × 10^19/cm3), leading to an increase in the carrier concentration and resulting in a decrease in electrical resistivity. The room temperature resistivity of 2.25 × 10−5 Ω m was obtained for our Zn4Sb3 sample. This is in good agreement with the reported one . However, our value is about twofold as large as that (0.8 × 10−5 Ω m) reported by Souma et al. , this difference arises due to the different microstructures (such as porosity and grain sizes) of the samples obtained by using different sintering techniques (hot-pressing was used in the present study and spark plasma sintering was used by them).",

The effect of Cu doping on the electrical resistivity, band gap, the Seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity was investigated. The power factors of the Cu-doped samples increase greatly due to the decrease of electrical resistivity and the higher Seebeck coefficient in high temperatures. In addition, the thermal conductivities of the Cu-doped samples also reduce due to the extra phonon scattering from the point defects introduced by Cu doping. As a result, the thermoelectric performance of MnTe is greatly enhanced, and a maximum ZT value of ∼0.55 in the Mn0.925Cu0.075Te sample at 773 K is achieved, which is 35% greater than that of the pristine MnTe sample.",

These results highlight the mu quarternary alloying with Mg and Se, and demonstrate the realiua. Quarternary alloys of Pb1exMgxTe0.8Se0.2 were designed to i merit zT. A maximum zT of ~2.2 at 820 K was achieved in chalcogenides, which are described using a building block approach, and of the potential of these materials for thermoelectric applications. This review provides an overview of the structural chemistry of layered oxy-through the utilization of a rational pseudocubic structure that results into cubic-like degenerate electronic bands. Based on the concept of conductive network, we propose the optimization scheme for both electrical and thermal transport properties in caged filled skutterudites and caged-free Cu-based diamond-like compounds. Through the high throughput screening method, several promising half-Heusler compositions with high power factors are proposed out of a large composition collection. At last, we enhance electricalnetwork, dimensionality reduction by quantum effects, and high throughput material and Boltzmann transport theory, a new strategy is introduced to design high-perform. The lowest lattice thermal conductivity that was produced in the 2 mol% Na doped (PbTe)0.88(PbS)0.12Na0.02 material was elucidated by the micro structural analysis and confirmed by the Callaway's model.

Recently, wide band gap semiconductors are frequently employed as potential TE materials due to their intrinsic large Seebeck coefficient and low thermal conductivity , which can work at a relatively high temperature. Thus, MnTe can be a potential candidate for middle-temperature thermoelectric application. Some studies have focused on the low-temperature electrical, magnetic and optical properties of MnTe compound , and MnTe has also been incorporated into PbTe, GeTe and SnTe thermoelectric materials to improve their thermoelectric performance. However, less attention has been paid to its own intrinsic thermoelectric performance. More recently, Kim, et al. prepared bulk non-stoichiometric MnTe materials by a melt-quenching plus spark plasma sintering method, and achieved a high Seebeck coefficient of over 600 μV/K at room temperature and a promising ZT value of ∼0.41 in the Mn0.51Te0.49 sample at 773 K. In the light of the band structure of MnTe, the large Seebeck coefficient is closely related to the large band gap and the p-d overlap induced van Hove singularity in the electron density of states near the valence band edge . Xie et al. reported an enhanced TE performance in a sulfur doped MnTe in a low temperature range as a consequence of the increase of electrical properties and the decrease of thermal conductivity, however, the TE performance at a high temperature has no improvement at all. In general, the large electrical resistivity hinders the compound from achieving a high ZT value. Therefore, tuning its electrical properties is a key issue to improve the TE performance of the compound. Clearly, there are two possible doping sites in MnTe, i.e., the cation and anion sites. Some work on anion doping have already been tried, however, little work on cation doping in MnTe have ever been reported yet.",

The power factor of Mn0.925Cu0.075Te becomes the maximum of 584.2 μW m−1K−2 at 773 K due to the decrease of the electrical resistivity and the relative high Seebeck coefficient at elevated temperature, which is 35.3% greater than that of the un-doped MnTe sample.",

It can be seen that σ of the film with x = 0.7 increases slightly with increasing temperature, showing the semiconducting behavior (a). When x = 1.1 and 1.5, the electrical conductivity of the films gradually decreases as temperature increases, showing a typical metal conduction behavior. Such metal-insulator transition can be attributed to the greatly increased carrier concentrations in the films with x = 1.1 and 1.5 as revealed by the Hall effect measurement. Interestingly, Sb doping also induces a metal-insulator transition in Bi2Se3 thin films which is evidenced by the temperature-dependent resistance . For films with x = 0 and 2, the electrical conductivity is less affected by changing temperature. The electrical conductivity of all doped films is higher than that of the undoped Bi2Te3 film. The electrical conductivity of the film with x = 1.5 (Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3) is the largest in the Bi2-xSbxTe3 film series. The largest conductivity reaches to be 2.95 × 10^5 S m-1 at 300 K, about ten times higher than that of the undoped Bi2Te3 film and more than three times higher than the reported films conductivity (~ 0.8 × 10^5 S m-1) and bulk conductivity (~ 0.8 × 10^5 S m-1) of Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3. The optimized electrical conductivity can be attributed to the high carrier concentration and carrier mobility, suggesting that a particular morphology of the films is favorable for carrier transport. b shows the relationship between Seebeck coefficient and temperature for the films. Since S and carrier concentration n are related by S∝n-2/3, the large carrier concentration leads to a relatively small Seebeck coefficient of Bi2-xSbxTe3 films here. It can be seen that Seebeck coefficient for Bi2Te3 film is largest in all films for the measured temperature range. This is mainly due to the increase in carrier concentration of the doped films. At above 450 K, the Seebeck coefficient of films with x = 0.7 and 1.1 begins to decrease, which may be caused by the bipolar effect . Obviously, the Seebeck coefficient of the Bi2-xSbxTe3 films with x ≤ 1.1 is negative, i.e. n-type conductivity; when x > 1.1, the Seebeck coefficient of Bi2-xSbxTe3 films is positive, corresponding to p-type semiconductor. Similar variation trend of Seebeck coefficient is more clearly shown in b. These illustrate that, with increasing Sb concentrations, the majority carriers change from electrons to",

All InxCeyCo4Sb12/InSb samples show high zT values which are largely due to a strongly suppressed lattice thermal conductivity while maintaining very good electrical transport properties. The maximum value of the dimensional figure of merit of ∼1.5 is achieved on the MS-SPS-processed In0.2Ce0.15Co4Sb12/InSb sample at 800 K. Compared with the traditional method, the application of MS-SPS technique may further enhance the zT by 15%. We also estimated zT as a function of Hall carrier concentration at 300 K based on the quality factor model by assuming a constant κL (d). Based on d, the optimum carrier concentration of the skutterudite compounds is found to be ∼1.25 × 10^20 e−/cm3. Current samples have slightly higher carrier concentrations than the optimal one. Therefore, further enhancement of the thermoelectric efficiencies is possible by tuning the charge carrier concentration in this system.",

Introducing a high density of grain boundaries, i.e. reducing the grain size, enables also effective phonon scattering as proposed by Dresselhaus et al. [].

On the other hand, the planar fault density inside the grain was found to be much lower NPF=1.5⋅10^6m−1. It is noteworthy that the LAGBs in this study are primarily parallel to the solidification direction, as discussed at the beginning of the section. Such microstructure is expected to scatter more phonons travelling in a radial direction, thereby deterring the heat flow in the radial direction more efficiently. A polycrystalline microstructure would make such effect more isotropic. In order to make phonon scattering by planar faults more significant, the material needs more volume of LAGBs with a high density of planar faults. For example, as reported by Hong et al. [], AgSbTe1.85Se0.15 with a very fine polycrystalline grain size of ∼2 μm and a high number of planar faults has a lattice thermal conductivity of <0.4 W m−1 K−1 at room temperature.",

To improve on the shortcoming, one viable approach was to incorporate these metal oxides directly into highly conductive substrates to fabricate hybrid supercapacitor electrodes [,,,].

However, the rather high electrical resistivity of undoped BiCuSeO may preclude its potential thermoelectric applications. Herein, we achieved enhanced thermoelectric performance in rare-earth Sm-doped BiCuSeO by the band structure engineering. The replacement of Bi3+ by Sm3+ leads to the improvement of electrical conductivity, from 34 S cm−1 for pristine BiCuSeO to 79 S cm−1 for that of Bi0.94Sm0.06CuSeO at 873 K. Coupled with the large Seebeck coefficient (251 μVK−1) and relatively low thermal conductivity (0.58 Wm−1K−1), the figure of merit ZT is significantly increased from 0.49 for pristine BiCuSeO to 0.74 for Bi0.94Sm0.06CuSeO at 873 K. According to the first-principles calculation, the enhanced thermoelectric properties was ascribed to the decreased band gap by the substitution of Sm. Upon 10%Sm substitution, the band gap of BiCuSeO decreases from 0.50 eV to 0.34 eV, which promotes the density of states near the Fermi level. The present study suggests that rare-earth element can be effective in modifying the band structure of BiCuSeO and thus improving its electronic transport properties.",

The GaGeTe monolayer with high carrier mobility, tunable band structure, and low cleavage energy attracts rapidly growing interests in electronics. However, their vibrational modes and phonon properties are not explored. Based on ﬁrst-principles calculations within the framework of density functional perturbation theory, we systematically study the lattice vibrational modes as well as phonon thermal conductivity of single-layer GaGeTe, which could be exfoliated from the experimentally synthesized GaGeTe crystal. We ﬁnd that the frequencies and intensities of A1g and Eg Raman modes, contributing to the main peaks in Raman spectra of monolayer GaGeTe, show distinct responses to different external strains. The calculated lattice thermal conductivity of GaGeTe is about 58 Wm-1 K−1, which is comparable to that of MoS2 (around 52 Wm−1K−1) and two orders of magnitude lower than that of graphene (2000 Wm−1K−1) at room temperature. This is mainly due to the partial couple for acoustic branches and low frequency optic phonon branches, moderate group velocity, strong anharmonic ZA phonon branch. Moreover, atom substitution at tellurium could be as effective strategies to further decrease lattice thermal conductivity. Our findings fill in the gap about the thermal transport properties of GaGeTe monolayer and trigger for further experimental verification of the predicted properties.",

According Zhang's report, the GaGeTe monolayer remains its thermally stable phase above 600 K, and will be destroyed when considering its high temperatures between 600 and 900 K []. At 600 K, the calculated lattice thermal conductivity of GaGeTe monolayer are 28.23 Wm−1K−1. When considering its high temperature region (600–800 K), GaGeTe monolayer will further realize an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity due to enhanced intrinsic anharmonic scattering from thermal population of higher-frequency phonons. With temperature increasing, the thermal conductivity gradually decreases to a constant value of 20 Wm−1K−1 at 800 K. The excellent thermal stability ensures it could work above room temperature, promising for further gains in electronic device performance operating at room temperature region.",

Only one IR peak (Eu) appears at 186.9 cm−1 while two peaks of Raman modes are at 284.7 cm−1 (Eg) and 305.2 cm−1 (A1g). We have explored how the IR-active and Raman-active modes change in frequency under biaxial strains. Calculated results show that 2D GaGeTe exhibit low κL of 58 Wm−1K−1 at room temperature, significantly lower than that of graphene. In addition, our findings demonstrate the remarkable tunability of chemistry and orbital interactions with Te atoms will heavily modified phonon properties and have the chance to significantly decrease thermal conductivity. We expect that this holds certain theory support for GaGeTe-based materials for thermal related applications. Furthermore, the vibrational modes, Raman and IR spectroscopic studies, and phonon frequencies can give basic elemental information about the materials, and are also important for the fundamental theoretical understanding of many experimental characterizations.",

In this work, we investigate theeffect of copper doping in thermoelectric properties of layered MoS2 nanosheets. X-ray Diffraction analysis and HRTEM micrographs show the reduction in interatomic spacing which confirms the interaction of copper ions with MoS2 lattice. Downshift in X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) of Cu doped samples proves the shift of Fermi energy near to the valence band and it results in the enhancement of electrical conductivity of Cu doped MoS2 samples from 0.75 Sm−1 to 14.20 Sm−1 (for 7.5 wt% Cu doped sample). Thus, obtained maximum power factor of 0.313 µWcm−1K−2 for 7.5 wt% Cu doped MoS2 at 420 K.",

For instance, at 430 °C, the electrical conductivity of LaCoO3 is about two orders of magnitude larger than that of LaFeO3 and one order of magnitude larger than that of LaCrO3. This trend is in agreement with that reported in literature for bulk ceramics with the similar compositions . The electrical conductivity of LaFeO3 at 560 °C was measured to be 0.39S cm−1, which is close to the value of 0.36S cm−1 for bulk LaFeO3 reported by Hung et al. . LaMnO3 presents a conductivity of 4.80S cm−1at 560 °C, which is close to ∼5.5 S cm−1 reported by Fujihira et al. for films prepared on Al2O3 substrates using the sol–gel method. The electrical conductivity mechanism of LaMO3 (M=Cr, Co, Fe and Mn) perovskite oxides has been discussed by several authors. It is largely accepted in the literature that the charge transfer occurs via the M–O–M bonds due to the exchange of the electronic state of the transition metal between M+4 and M+3. It is worth noting that the transition metal (M) in LaMO3 perovskites is present in the M+3 oxidation state.",

Compared to the film grown at normal angle, the power factor of the film deposited at glancing angle is enhanced significantly (>20 times higher). The enhancement of power factor is mainly contributed by the increase of Seebeck coefficient. The increment of Seebeck coefficient via the grain size control strategy can be explained by potential barrier scattering at grain boundaries. This concept has been investigated in theoretical and experimental ways, for bulk and thin film scales . Given a TE material with one type of mobile carrier, after a constant thermal gradient is applied onto the material, the carriers in the material will move from the hot side to the cold side by diffusion so as to induce the Seebeck voltage. Consequently, a potential difference will be developed on the both sides, drifting the mobile charge carrier back to the original position and diminishing the Seebeck voltage.",

For the bulk material, the SnSe single crystal has the highest power factor of 10.1μWcm−1K−2 at ∼973 K. The lower operation temperature of the thin film compared to the bulk single crystal may be due to the reduction of material dimension. Compared to the SnSe thin films deposited by other researchers , the room temperature Seebeck coefficient of the sample in the present study (262.2μV/K) is lower, while the room-temperature Seebeck coefficients in previous study on different substrates were from 432μV/K to 505μV/K. Compared to the bulk single crystal SnSe , the increasing trend of out-of-plane thin film thermal conductivity is different from that of bulk SnSe, which has a decreasing trend. The films in this study have much lower thermal conductivities, and we believe that the difference should be due to the grain and surface boundary scattering. Since the out-of-plane thermal conductivity cannot be used directly with in-plane electrical properties to evaluate zT, we will not give a particular value of zT in this paper, even based on a very conservative estimation the zT value could be much higher than the bulk single crystal. We will report the in-plane thermal conductivity and zT value elsewhere.",

On Fe substitution, the electrical resistivity decreases in Fe0.2Co3.8Sb12 (10 μΩ m) compared with undoped Co4Sb12 (70 μΩ m) (at 300 K). In Co4Sb12−xTex (x\n= 0.05–0.6) the electrical resistivity decreases from 28 μΩ m to 9 μΩ m, owing to an increase in the carrier concentration with an increase in Te content, and for ρ(T) the behaviour of a degenerate semiconductor was observed. However, for Te substitution in Fe0.2Co3.8Sb12−xTex (x\n= 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6), two different trends were observed for electrical resistivity. For x\n= 0.1 and x\n= 0.2, the electrical resistivity at 300 K increases to 60 μΩ m and 119 μΩ m, respectively, and at 793 K it decreases to 67 μΩ m and 41 μΩ m, respectively, as in the case of undoped Co4Sb12. The temperature-dependent resistivity behaviour shows a semiconducting nature. For the Te-doped skutterudites, the Fermi level lies between the intrinsic level and conduction.

Band energy structures, effective masses, relaxation time and carrier mobility of these structures are also obtained. The elastic constants and the deformation potential constants of each structure are calculated with the deformation potential theory. The lattice thermal conductivity is calculated by employing the Slack equation and elastic matrix. The electronic thermal conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and power factors are obtained by solving the Boltzmann equation. Finally, the dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) is evaluated. The results demonstrate that a maximum ZT value of 0.8–1.2 could be achieved for the n-type BAgX, and the largest one is 1.2 for the n-type BAgZr at the carrier concentration value of 1.17 × 10^20 with the temperature of 500 K, implying that the n-type BAgZr is a promising candidate for thermoelectric materials.",

Day et al. predicted that by reducing carrier concentration to 1.6 × 10^18 cm−3, a ZT value higher than 1 from 300 K to 600 K can be realized in Ag2+xSe (), and previous study reveals that the carrier concentration can be regulated by changing molar ratio of Ag/Se in the silver selenide samples (). For instance, Lee et al. investigated a series of samples with Ag/Se varying from 1.73 to 2.33, and it is found that the excess silver atoms promote the carrier concentration and diminish the Hall carrier mobility (). Perez-Taborda et al. demonstrated that the PF value of accurately controlled stoichiometric Ag2Se thin film on glass substrate reached up to 2440 ± 192 μW m−1 K−2 at room temperature (). Besides the non-flexible silver selenide materials, the flexible silver selenide film with outstanding performance has also been reported very recently. Cai's group published two articles about nylon-membrane-supported Ag2Se-nanowire-based flexible films in succession (), and an outstanding PF value of 2231.5 μWm−1K−2 at 300 K for flexible thermoelectric film was realized in CuAg4Se3 composite films.",

It also shows n- and p-type Seebeck coefficient (S=−275 and 400 μV/K) and diamagnetic behavior. MoSe2 compound was reported to be n-type with the Seebeck coefficient and resistivity values being −900 μV/K and 1.0 Ω/cm at room temperature, respectively. Although the transition metal dichalcogenides MoQ2 (Q=S, Se) are a good candidate for thermoelectric applications because of their high Seebeck coefficients (S) and low thermal conductivities (k), the MQ2 show large band gap size and low electron density near Fermi level. Therefore, in order to improve thermoelectric properties of MoQ2 (Q=S and Se), it is necessary decreasing of band gap and increasing of carrier concentration near Fermi level.",

Segalman et al. reported that PEODT-BiTe3 nanorod composites showed a high ZT of 0.1 at room temperature. The high ZT value is due to the low thermal conductivity of 0.2 W/m-K for the composite, which was thought to be caused by phonon scattering by the nanowires/nanorods. The relationship between the length of the nanostructures and TE performance was further investigated, but it remains unclear because an increase in the nanowire length is always accompanied by an increase in the diameter. The diameter of the nanostructures may considerably alter the TE properties, so further investigation is needed to understand the size-property relationship of the composites (",

When Br doping content (x) increased to 0.02, the Seebeck coefficients are negative in the whole measurement temperature range, which clearly show that Br is an effective electron dopant to realize n-type conducting SnS. It is readily seen that the n-type SnS samples possess large absolute Seebeck coefficients due to low carrier concentration, namely, the Seebeck coefficient of SnS0.98Br0.02 can reach as large as - 640 μV K−1 at 823 K.

The carrier concentration was firstly optimized through Sb doping, resulting in a maximum power factor of ~ 15.4 μW cm−1 K−2 and maximum ZT of ~ 0.9 at 873 K in Pb0.99Sb0.01Se. Then, Mg was selected for alloying in Pb sites to produce point defects, which can largely intensify the phonon scattering and lower thermal conductivity. After Mg alloying, the thermal conductivity at 300 K (873 K) was significantly suppressed from ~ 4.6 Wm−1 K−1 (1.5 Wm−1 K−1) for Pb0.99Sb0.01Se to ~ 2.9 Wm−1 K−1 (1.1 Wm−1 K−1) for Pb0.99Sb0.01Se-6%MgSe. Through combining Sb doping and Mg alloying, a maximum ZT of ~ 1.1 was achieved at 873 K for Pb0.99Sb0.01Se-6%MgSe, and the average ZT (ZTave) was increased by 28.6% from ~ 0.42 for Pb0.99Sb0.01Se to ~ 0.54 for Pb0.99Sb0.01Se-6%MgSe. The results indicate that PbSe is a robust candidate for medium-temperature thermoelectric applications.",

Recently, significant progress has been achieved with exceptional ZT in both p- and n-type PbTe systems . The typical instance is the p-type PbTe-SrTe system, the lattice thermal conductivity can be reduced enormously by using all-scale hierarchical architectures, and a ZT value of ~ 2.2 has been achieved at 915 K for PbTe–4%SrTe doped with 2% Na . Astonishingly, a record ZT of ~ 2.5 for Pb0.98Na0.02Te-8%SrTe can be realized through non-equilibrium processing, which can give much higher solubility of SrTe (5 mol%). The heavily dissolved fraction of SrTe can enlarge the bandgap and promote the convergence of the valence bands in PbTe . For n-type PbTe system, a high ZT value of ~ 1.7 at 700 K was reported in the LAST (AgPbmSbTe2+m) , in which the exceptionally low lattice thermal conductivity stemmed from the immense phonon scattering with nanoscale precipitates .",

                    "context": "(a), and the variation trend of κtot with the increasing temperature is similar to that of electrical conductivity. Additionally, the total thermal conductivity was augmented obviously with increasing Sb amount. It is well known that κtot is the sum of the electronic (κele) and lattice thermal conductivity (κlat). The temperature dependence of the electronic thermal conductivity is depicted in (b), which elucidates that the total thermal conductivity increased largely with increasing Sb doping fractions due to the contribution from the electronic thermal conductivity. The κele is proportional to the electrical conductivity (σ) through the Wiedemann-Franz relation, κele = LσT, where L is the Lorenz number shown in (f) . An estimation of the Lorenz number can be made using a single parabolic band (SPB) model and assuming acoustic phonon scattering . Results show that the lattice thermal conductivities for heavily Sb-doped samples were reduced, especially at high temperature since the point defects caused by Sb doping intensified phonon scattering . The minimum lattice thermal conductivity can reach as low as ~ 0.58 Wm−1 K−1 at 623 K for Pb0.9825Sb0.0175Se, as shown in (c). One can see that the lattice thermal conductivity at room temperature was slightly increased with the rise of Sb content, which may result from the compensations of Pb vacancies . After optimizing carrier concentration via Sb doping, the maximum ZT of ~ 0.9 was achieved for Pb0.99Sb0.01Se at 873 K, as shown in (d).",

                    "context": "The power factor (PF) is shown in e and f for the two approximations of the relaxation time. For the non-substituted compound TlInSe2 with constant τ the PF increases linearly. The SO coupling has no effect on the PF. A broad maximum is observed when taking the T-dependence of electron-phonon scattering into account. The maximum PF of 3.22 × 10−4 W/m-K2 is reached at 580 K. This value is comparable to the PF of state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials. For example, the PF of Cu2Se reaches a maximum of 1.3 × 10−3 W/m-K2 at T = 1000 K, SnSe along the crystallographic b-axis has a PF = 1.0 × 10−3 W/m-K2. In Li-substituted Tl0·5Li0·5InSe2 the PF only reaches a maximum of 1.93 × 10−4 W/m-K2 (2.62 × 10−4) at 230 K (250 K) for calculations with SO (WSO) coupling (f). This reduction in the PF demonstrates that the electronic properties of Tl0·5Li0·5InSe2 are less favorable with regard to thermoelectric applications. Hence, Li-substitution turns out not to be a suitable optimization strategy in terms of improving the electronic materials properties.",

A κ (T) maximum of about 2 W/K-m is observed at ∼80 K for FeSb2 which is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding single crystalline samples . A reduced thermal scattering at low temperatures is responsible for the observance of such a maxima. The overall reduction in the magnitude of κ (T) in polycrystalline samples compared to the single crystalline samples could be attributed to the phenomenon of boundary scattering of phonons and the enhanced Kapitza resistance at grain boundaries . In FeSb1.9, a κ (T) maximum of about 2.4 W/K-m is observed at ∼50 K. With further increase in Sb deficiency, a κ (T) maximum of about 0.5 W/K-m is observed at ∼65 K. Such a non-monotonicity in behavior as a function of Sb deficiency at low temperatures has been reported earlier . This points to the competing roles of electronic and lattice contribution to thermal conductivity with the increase in Sb deficiency in these samples. A characteristic T3/2 behavior of κ (T) at low temperatures is observed in all the reported samples. It should however be noted that the behavior is clearly monotonic as a function of increasing Sb deficiency at temperatures above 80 K. A four-fold decrease in κ in FeSb1.8 compared to the parent FeSb2 sample at high temperatures demonstrates the role of lattice imperfections in FeSb2 and could be employed as a route for enhancing zT in the system. A knowledge about the variation of electronic mean free path (le) and phonon mean free path (lp) as a function of T is desirable to understand the underlying physics. Using the kinetic theory result, κlat= 1/3Cvslp, where, vs is the sound velocity . The lattice contribution to thermal conductivity can be estimated from the thermal conductivity data making use of the Wiedemann-Franz law according to which, κe/σ=L0T, where the Lorenz number L0 = 2.44 × 10−22WΩK−2. Thus, κlat = κ − L0σT. Determination of le can be done within the Drude approximation where, le=m*ve/ne2ρ, with ve=√3kBT/m*, where, m*=me, the electronic mass . The temperature variation of le and lp are shown in .",

The Seebeck coefficient (a) of all samples is negative over the measured temperature range in agreement with the Hall measurement that shows electron-dominated transport. The absolute value of S increases with increasing temperature. The magnitude of S increases dramatically with increasing y from 0.025 to 0.05, and decreases with higher y of 0.1. Such a variation is in consistent with the change of carrier concentration n (), the values of which are −4.34 × 10^20 cm-3, -3.11 × 10^20 cm-3, and -3.45 × 10^20 cm-3 for y = 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively. S reaches the highest value of 238 μV/K at 760 K for CoSb2.8Te0.15Se0.05. The two y = 0.05 samples show nearly identical S over the measured temperature range. All samples show a positive temperature dependence of ρ (b), indicating a typical behavior of heavily doped semiconductors. ρ of the samples where y = 0.025 and 0.05 are close and much lower than y = 0.1, which is attributed to the combining effect of carrier concentration and mobility (). The power factor (c) of the sample where y = 0.05 is significantly enhanced because of the highest Seebeck coefficient and the lowest electrical resistivity achieved. The highest value of 4.34 mW m-1 K−2 is obtained at 760 K for CoSb2.8Te0.15Se0.05. S, ρ, and S2/ρ versus Se concentration (y) are shown in d. The optimized composition achieves the best electrical transport properties.",

The carrier concentration dependence of the Seebeck coefficient is shown in b. The experimental data in this work and literature results are both included. To evaluate the contribution of increased m* to the Seebeck coefficient, a two-band Kane (TBK) model [,] is used to fit the data. All the transition metal Ti-, V-, Cr-, Nb-, and Mo-doped and ⅢA element B-, Ga-, and In-doped n-type PbSe fell onto the fitting line with effective mass m* = 0.5 me, which is higher than that of the Cl- and Br-doped PbSe (m* = 0.27 me). The reason is that CBM is dominated by A-site cations' orbitals and doping at B sites cannot modulate its shape. The increased m* results in the increased S at the same electron concentration. However, different from the constant Seebeck coefficient due to the resonant level in Al-doped PbSe, the Seebeck coefficient of transition metal-doped PbSe shows a variable value with changing electron concentration. Because of the increased S, a high power factor at room temperature is achieved. The highest room temperature power factor is 3300 μW/m/K2 in 1% Mo-doped PbSe, which is 130% higher than that of the Cl-doped sample []. The largely improved PF because of the increased m* will result in high ZT values (as shown in d). The highest room temperature ZT is ∼0.5 in 1% Mo-doped PbSe and the highest peak ZT is ∼1.0 for 0.5% Cr-doped PbSe at about 673 K. Compared with In-doped PbSe samples, transition metal doping can largely increase the power factor and ZT value at low temperatures, resulting in a high average ZT value and conversion efficiency.",

And combining the use of coarse (about 48 μm) Ti and fine (about 25 nm) TiO2 with appropriate HPHT reactive sintering parameters, multi-scale hierarchical TiO2-x was achieved in just two hours, in addition to ubiquitous lattice defects brought about by HPHT, such as dislocations and lattice deformations. As a result for titanium oxide prepared by HPHT, an encouraging zT value of up to 0.33 at 700 °C was reported here. The reasons why thermoelectric performance can be substantially enhanced by our innovative strategy are discussed.",

Ubiquitous lattice defects engineering in our samples is another achievement. The power factors of TiO1.76 and TiO1.80 reach up to 5.43 and 5.63 μW cm−1 K−2 at 700 °C, respectively; furthermore, the thermal conductivity of our samples is reduced to 1.60 W m−1 K−1 at 700 °C for TiO1.76, and a high dimensionless figure of merit up to 0.33 is obtained at 700 °C in TiO1.76. It was demonstrated here that HPHT is also valid for the fabrication of titanium dioxide based thermoelectric materials. Through the combination of the appropriate ratio of coarse Ti to fine TiO2 and suitable HPHT conditions, we can easily obtain the desirable microstructure to achieve the promotion of thermoelectric performance. Thus, the strategy of reducing the thermal conductivity via rational engineering of multi-scale hierarchical structure and lattice defects, being conducted by HPHT, has great potential to achieve high-performance oxide thermoelectric materials.",

Na is recognized as an effective p-type dopant in PbTe, resulting in a hole concentration in the range of 10^18 to 10^20 cm−3 at room temperature. Recently, a high ZT of ∼1.4 was achieved in heavily doped PbTe with Na content close to 2%. At high doping levels, the transport properties of PbTe are dominated by holes with high effective mass as a result of the broadening of the Fermi distribution. This is particularly effective at high temperature when the light and heavy valence bands converge. Based on a modeling study that considered the above-mentioned band features, the optimum ZT of heavily doped p-type PbTe is ∼1.7 at 750 K. Here we confirm this assertion experimentally by doping PbTe with large amounts of Na (4%), resulting in the highest known ZT for non-nanostructured p-type PbTe (∼1.7 at 810 K).",

The calculations were performed by using the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method in conjunction with Boltzmann’s transport theory and Bardeen-Shockley’s deformation potential with the carrier relaxation time and effective mass approximations. We calculated the band effective masses inside two energy windows of 125 meV; one above the fundamental conduction band minimum (FCBM) and the second below the valence band maximum (VBM). The calculated band effective masses exhibit a noticeable anisotropy and demonstrate that the n-type SrIn2P2 transport properties are better than those of the p-type one over the considered charge-carrier concentration range at room-, intermediate- and high-temperature, due to the proximity of the secondary conduction band minimums to the FCBM (∼58 meV). The n-type SrIn2P2 has a considerable Seebeck coefficient (429 μV/K), an extremely low electrical resistivity (0.90 mΩcm), and a relatively small lattice thermal conductivity (1.12 Wm−1K−1), which yield a figure of merit ZT of 0.87 for an electron concentration of 3.0 × 10^19 cm−3 at 900 K. These results make SrIn2P2 a hopeful n-type thermoelectric material if we can further reduce its lattice thermal conductivity.",

Low-temperature applications of TEC’s have been designed and characterized by Akshay et al., based on Bi2Te3 nanostructures []. However, the synthesization of nanostructured Bi2Te3 and its thermoelectric properties reveal fascinating results with α = −120 μVK−1 []. Then in 2017, authors reported the synthesization of Bi2Te3 and their proposed TEC’s α was −135 μVK−1 and the observed thermal conductivity was about 0.957 W (mK)−1 []. Another group of scientists fabricated and characterized thin-film based TEC’s based on n-type nanocrystalline Bi2Te3 and results showed that the obtained Seebeck coefficient was −186.1 μVK−1 []. In Ref. [], n-type Bi2Te3 ultrathin nanowires were synthesized and providing ZT of 0.96 at 380 K. An alloy of n-type Bi2Te3 with Indium was fabricated to achieve high bandgap, aiding to suppress bipolar conduction and resulting in ZT of ∼1.1 at 625 K in 2018 []. In same year Du et al., synthesized flexible n-type tungsten composites and the obtained Seebeck coefficients vary from −11 to −12.3 μV/K at ∼300 K []. Crackless Bi2Te3 film doped with n-type impurity fabricated by electrophoretic deposition was obtained in 2018, resulting in ‘α’ of −189 μVK−1 at 500 K []. ZT about 0.83 was obtained by a sintering process of controlled oxygen content in n-type Bi2Te3 compounds at 473 K in Ref. []. Another n-type Bi2Te3 was prepared in Ref. [] by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering and ZT of ∼0.57 at 375 K was attained. In 2018, again the thermoelectric performance of Bi2Te3 with reduced graphene oxide composite was investigated and obtained ZT (0.29) at room temperature [].",

Relatively small electrical resistivity (4–60 μΩm in 300–1000 K) combined with fairly high positive Seebeck coefficient (40–160 μV/K) yielded for the RENiSb ternaries rather large thermoelectric power factors at 750 K, namely 14 μW K−2cm−1 for ScNiSb and 11 μW K−2cm−1 for TmNiSb. At room temperature the thermal conductivity measured for the two materials was 8.1 W K−1m−1 and 4.4 W K−1m−1, respectively. The value obtained for the latter compound is smaller than those reported for unoptimized half-Heusler phases based on d-electron elements. This finding may be explained by strong point defect scattering occurring due to intrinsic disorder in crystal structure of TmNiSb, or to smaller extent by enhanced scattering on incoherent grain boundaries with the impurity phases. Nevertheless, achieving good thermoelectric performance of the RENiSb phases at high temperatures requires proper tuning of carrier concentration, as well as further reduction in their thermal conductance by means of alloying and/or nanostructurization.",

The κ value of 4.4 W K−1m−1 at room temperature is significantly smaller than those of ScNiSb and d-electron HH phases before alloying and nanostructurization: HfNiSn (6.3 W K−1m−1), ZrNiSn (8 W K−1m−1), TiNiSn (9 W K−1m−1) [], VFeSb (13 W K−1m−1) [], ZrCoBi (9 W K−1m−1) []. The sound velocity of 3214 m/s calculated for TmNiSb is similar to that of ScNiSb. The Debye-Callaway analysis yielded the parameters: U = 3.9 × 10−18 K−1 s, C = 50 K, L = 1.6 × 10−6 m, A = 9.96 × 10−42 s3, and Γ  = 0.106. The Umklapp scattering and grain boundary differ from those obtained for much lighter and less dense ScNiSb, however they are still in the range expected for HH compounds [,]. The point defect scattering parameters obtained from the refinement are comparable to pseudo-quaternary and pseudo-quintuple HH phases, while ternary HH compositions usually exhibit order of magnitude lower A and Γ [,]. Most likely explanation for the enhanced point defect scattering observed in the sample measured is strong intrinsic disorder in its crystal structure, in concert with the small value of κ at room temperature. Furthermore, the small thermal conductivity in TmNiSb complies with a rather large theoretical density of this material (9.5 g/cm3).",

After a graphite powder burial sintering process, the sintered bulk samples had complex structures with exterior shell and internal vesicular and high dislocation densities. Such structures produced an ultrahigh electrical conductivity of ∼5300 S cm−1 at 300 K, a low lattice thermal conductivity of ∼1.6 W m−1 K−1 from 700 to 1100 K for LaDy-Nb20, and the corresponding total thermal conductivity was 3.5 W m−1 K−1. In addition to the above complex structures, the existence of rutile TiO2 phases in the LaDy-Nb05 bulk sample further reduced the total thermal conductivity to be 2.95 W m−1 K−1. By varying the Nb content, maximum zT values of 0.28 for LaDy-Nb05 and 0.27 for LaDy-Nb20 at 1100 K were achieved. These findings suggest potential for developing the thermoelectric properties of SrTiO3 through multielement doping and complex structural designs.",

A vacancy order–disorder phase transition, occurring at ∼580 °C from a monoclinic α form to a cubic β form results in the high anionic conductivity []. This phase transition leads to an abrupt volume expansion, which may be suppressed by a minor doping of La2Mo2O9. The maximum conductivity is reported for the compositions La1.7Bi0.3Mo2O9−δ, La2Mo1.7W0.3O9−δ, and La2Mo1.95V0.05O9−δ []. The stability in reducing atmosphere is an issue for these materials as La2Mo2O9 may loose about 1.14 of its 9 oxygen per unit formula. Substitution of lanthanum by other rare earths (Nd, Gd) increases the oxygen loss, thus, further investigation about appropriate doping should be pursued to improve stability and performance.",

The multiple and multiscale nanostructures can be spontaneously formed by rapid pressure-quenching from the melt, including the nanocrystals and the lattice disorders. Besides, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were also dispersed into the material to have more interfaces. The thermal conductivity by the HPHT quenching method is lower than that by other nanostructuring methods, and the minimum value of the material is 0.74 Wm−1K−1 at 373 K. The Seebeck coefficient is improved by low energy carrier filtering at grain boundaries and phase interfaces when the electrical conductivity is less deteriorated. The maximum ZT of Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 bulk material with 0.1 wt.% CNTs is 1.42 at 373 K and 4 GPa. The HPHT quenching method can provide a promising alternative to obtain nanostructured bulk composite materials with the enhanced thermoelectric performance.",

Kim et al. developed a liquid-phase-compaction method to form dense dislocation arrays, and obtained a remarkable high ZT value of 1.86 at 320 K for Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3. Poudel et al. obtained a ZT value of 1.4 at 373 K in BiSbTe nanocrystalline bulk by ball-milling and hot pressing from commercial alloy ingot, which resulted from grain boundaries and defects scattering . Similarly, Ma et al. achieved a ZT value of 1.3 at 348–373 K by the same nanostructuring approach with elemental chunks as starting materials . Li et al. reported an improved ZT value of 1.33 at 373 K for Bi0.3Sb1.7Te3 by SiC nanoparticles, which resulted in the reduction of lattice thermal conductivity . BiSbTe3 bulks by Cao et al. via a hydrothermal route and a hot pressing had a high ZT value of 1.47 at 443 K . Xie et al. obtained a ZT value of 1.56 at 300 K when they used a melt spinning/spark plasma sintering technique . In a previous work, we obtained a ZT value of 1.3 at 510 K in Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 bulk through a high-pressure synthesis (at 3.8 GPa) . The enhancement of the ZT value in this work indicates that pressure-quenching could be effective to fabricate the high-performance nanostructured bulk materials.",

                    "context": "Symmetry reduction in the crystal structure generally splits the electronic bands according to the degree of symmetry reduction. The electronic transport can be enhanced significantly via proper crystal-structure engineering if many split bands with slightly different energy converge together to result in high valley degeneracy, which is even sometimes better than that of the high-symmetry structure. The symmetry reduction can simultaneously reduce the lattice thermal conductivity. In Joule, Pei and co-workers showed a high zT of ∼2.4 at 600 K in rhombohedral GeTe, which is significantly higher than the previously reported cubic analog of GeTe (B). Practical application demands high zT throughout the measured temperature range, which is governed by the device figure of merit (ZT). Rhombohedral GeTe showed a record-high device ZT of 1.5 in the temperature range of 300–800 K. Significantly high zTmax and ZT values in rhombohedral Bi- and Pb-doped GeTe can be attributed to slight symmetry breaking of the crystal structure, which synergistically improves the electronic transport properties via convergence of the split valence bands and reduces the lattice thermal conductivity. Thus, an optimized low-symmetry solid will be an important candidate for next-generation thermoelectrics, which expands the possibility of a search for a new inorganic solid stabilized in a slightly low-symmetry structure.",

Structure of BaErMn2O5 is tetragonal (likely P4/nmm space group) at room temperature, while BaErMn2O6 exhibits either monoclinic P121 or triclinic P−1 symmetry. In situ XRD studies revealed complex behavior with the oxidation of BaErMn2O5 occurring at around 300 °C. BaErMn2O5-BaErMn2O6 system shows interesting oxygen storage-related properties, similar to the ones observed previously for BaYMn2O5–BaYMn2O6. The reversible oxygen storage capacity exceeds 3 wt%. Electrical properties of BaErMn2O5 indicate activated character of electrical conductivity on temperature, with Ea=0.30(1) eV in 50–500 °C range, with σ value at RT of the order of 10−4\nS cm−1. Oxidized BaErMn2O6 possesses much higher electrical conductivity, almost 0.2 S cm−1 at room temperature. At about 225 °C structural and magnetic (from charge/orbital-ordered insulator COI(CE) to paramagnetic metal PM phase) phase transitions occur for this material, which can be associated with about tenfold increase of electrical conductivity. BaErMn2O6 possesses the highest conductivity of almost 40 S cm−1 near 500 °C. Seebeck coefficient is positive for BaYMn2O5 and negative for BaYMn2O6, indicating substantial changes in electronic structure, as caused by changing oxygen content.",

The power factors of all samples increase with the increase in temperature, indicating high thermal stability at elevated temperatures. Among the studied samples, Ca2.7Y0.3Co4O9+δ shows the largest power factor (3.05 × 10−4 W m−1 K−2) at 1073 K because of the largest Seebeck coefficient. This result indicates that the substitution of Y3+ is highly effective in improving the electrical transport properties of Ca3Co4O9. Furthermore, the power factors of the Ca3−xYxCo4O9+δ fabricated using sol−gel processed powders are larger than those fabricated using commercial powders (Supplementary Fig. S1(c)). The power factors of the Ca3−xYxCo4O9+δ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.3) fabricated using commercial powders range from 1.2 × 10−4 to 1.6 × 10−4 W m−1 K−2 at 773 K and from 2.1 × 10−4 to 2.73 × 10−4 W m−1 K−2 at 1073 K.",

Ag2Te is a superionic conductor; however, its small band gap and large Ag vacancy formation energy impede its application as a prominent p-type thermoelectric material. In this work, synergistic optimization of the thermoelectric performance of Ag2Te through Cu substitution is realized through a combination of experimental and theoretical efforts. For the electrical transport, Cu substitution systematically increases the band gap of Ag2Te and reduces the cation vacancy formation energy. These two beneficial effects simultaneously increase the electrical conductivity and suppress the bipolar effect, thereby greatly enhancing the p-type electrical transport properties of Ag2Te. For the thermal transport, alloying Cu2Te with Ag2Te significantly reduces the thermal conductivity through not only point defect scattering but also softening of the interatomic interactions. The latter is attributed to the relatively small Cu atoms vibrating in the oversized 8c sites. This two-fold optimization results in maximum thermoelectric figure of merit zT values of over 1.3 at 773 K for both Ag1.2Cu0.8Te and AgCuTe, demonstrating the great potential of Ag2−xCuxTe as a promising p-type thermoelectric material system.",

Now, due to the inconsistent reports of structures within this composition range, there is almost too much property data available. For example, the room temperature electrical conductivities of DyCuTe2 and ErCuTe2 are an order of magnitude lower (12.5 S/cm and 50 S/cm respectively) [] when reported in the monoclinic space group (XIV) than they are in their most recent report (∼840 S/cm and ∼950 S/cm respectively) [] as trigonal structures (IX). Meanwhile, compared to their trigonal counterparts the room temperature Seebeck coefficient is markedly lower for ErCuTe2, (39 μV/K for XIV vs ∼60 μV/K for IX) but higher for DyCuTe2 (144 μV/K for XIV vs ∼100 μV/K for IX) [,]. Recent reports of structure XIV on Cu doping in GdCu1+xTe2 also demonstrate a range of conductivities of 33–58 S/cm as well as a range of Seebeck coefficients of 172–236 μV/K (leading to an overall maximum zT of 0.21 at 540 K for GdCu1.25Te2) [], however there is no data on a structure IX analogue available for comparison. As the temperature rises, IX structure transitions to its HTP of VII, finally allowing for some of its electronic properties to be tested. From a thermoelectric standpoint, this is where the most fruitful discoveries have been. TmCuTe2 was the first representative to report notable mid/high temperature zT values with a maximum of 0.81 at 745 K []. Next was a report of YCuTe2, which utilized intrinsic doping of Cu to reach an appreciable zT of 0.75 at 780 K []. Finally, testing of (Tb-Er)CuTe2 was completed, yielding the highest value to date within the R-M-Te family of structures for TbCuTe2 with zT = 1.0 at 750 K []. With the incorporation of other thermoelectric optimization techniques, these structures show great promise.",

Because oxides have the merits of long-time use in air at high temperature, they would possibly be regarded as promising thermoelectric materials due to their potential to thermoelectric power generation by waste heat . In general, the thermoelectric performance of oxide compounds is always believed to be much lower than that of the semiconductor alloys. However, Terasaki et al. have recently reported a high Seebeck coefficient (100 μV/K at 300 K) and a low resistivity (200 μΩ cm at 300 K) for NaCo2O4 single crystal. These data indicate that some semiconducting oxides may be possible for thermoelectric applications. Because of the volatility of sodium above 1073 K and hygroscopicity of NaCo2O4 in air, its practical application is quite limited. So, it is necessary to find new stable oxide systems with good thermoelectric properties.",

Indeed, δ-Bi2O3 exhibits the highest ionic conductivity of >1 S/cm at 800 °C, but is only stable in a narrow temperature regime between 730 °C and its melting temperature of 804 °C. This stability regime can be extended to lower temperatures by extrinsic doping of the Bi-sublattice typically by Y2O3 or Er2O3, although usually at the expense of lower conductivity. Electrolytes based on these doped oxides have been considered for low temperature SOFC applications but their major shortcoming is their chemical instability in the reducing environment at the anode side of the SOFC. This usually leads to onset of p-type electronic conduction in the case of doped-ceria due to the reduction of Ce+4 to Ce+3 thus reducing the useful cell voltage, and, in the case of doped-Bi2O3, possible shorting or failure of the cell by the reduction of Bi2O3 to metallic Bi or by volatilization . However, in many cases, this shortcoming can be circumvented by the use of bi-layer electrolyte architecture. Indeed, thin film YSZ interlayers deposited on the anode faces of the doped-CeO2 or -Bi2O3 electrolytes physically isolate the electrolyte from the reducing gas environment and helps prevent electrolyte stability problems associated with the effect of reduction reactions .",

These properties, however, have been only observable in well-prepared and properly handled single-crystal samples. Polycrystalline SnSe samples have markedly inferior properties paradoxically with higher apparent thermal conductivity and much lower ZT values than single crystals. The high thermal conductivity in polycrystalline samples has been attributed to surface tin oxides. Based on this hypothesis, we have employed an oxide-removing strategy that involves a chemical reduction process at 613 K under a 4% H2/Ar atmosphere. This leads to an exceptionally low lattice thermal conductivity of ∼0.11 W m−1K−1 in polycrystalline hole-doped SnSe alloyed with 5% lead selenide, even lower than that of single crystals, and boosts the ZT to ∼2.5 at 773 K.",

Strong correlation is found between structural and thermoelectric properties. Structural studies confirm the enhancement in lattice defects/disorder and volume defects created by S doping, which creates highly strained lattice. These lattice defects combined with bulk defects scatter the charge carriers and phonons to provide a moderate Seebeck coefficient of ~240 μV/K and low lattice thermal conductivity of ~0.53 W/m.K with a ZT of ~1.2 at 413 K for highly doped Bi2Te2S materials. Reports suggested that in order to achieve high thermoelectric efficiency in Bi2Te3, either a complex synthesis route or toxic dopant is required. But, in the current study, improved ZT is achieved in Bi2Te3 by using non-toxic S dopant with simple and economic solid-state synthesis routes. Hence, incorporation of S in Bi2Te3 could be a viable technique to attain high thermoelectric performance.",

With increasing temperature, the Seebeck coefficient firstly increases and then decreases after about 580 K, which is consistent with the result of Zeming . In addition, the Seebeck coefficient of Fe0.6Co3.4Sb12 is higher than that of CoSb3, which is possibly due to the decreasing carrier concentration by Fe substituting for Co. Especially, the maximal Seebeck coefficient 148.77 μV/K was obtained for Fe0.6Co3.4Sb12 at about 550 K, which is higher than the result of Soon-Chul Ur (∼80 μV/K) .",

With the increase of Ag content in the sample, the resistivity ρ is greatly reduced compared with the Mg3Sb2 pure phase due to the increase of carrier concentration and mobility, which is consistent with the changes in . A minimum resistivity of 3.5 × 10−5 Ω m was obtained at 773 K in Mg2.96Ag0.04Sb2. The Seebeck coefficient is positive ((b)), in according with the Hall coefficient. The result shows that the Mg3-xAgxSb2 samples all exhibit p type conduction, and the hole is the main mode of conduction. The samples show a downward trend in the measured temperature range, revealing that the carrier concentration is lower at room temperature. As the temperature increases, the thermal excitation increases and the electrons are more likely to transition from the valence band to the conduction band, resulting in an increase in carrier concentration. Under the combined action of carrier concentration and mobility, the Seebeck coefficient decreased significantly with the increase of Ag content (). The power factor of Mg3-xAgxSb2 is calculated by the equation PF = α2/ρ and the results are presented in (c). The samples show the PF value is significantly enhanced with the increase of Ag content. The maximum power factor 5.21 × 10−4 W/m·K2 is obtained for x = 0.04 at 723 K, which is 3 times higher than that for pristine Mg3Sb2 (1.42 × 10−4W/m·K2). In this paper, the power factor of Mg1.96Ag0.04Sb2 is 5.21 × 10−4 W/m·K2 at 773 K, which is higher than 4.6 × 10−4 W/m·K2 of Mg1.985Ag0.015Sb2 in the literature, probably due to the resistivity of the latter sample is not the lowest since the XRD shows that there is still some unreacted Sb at x = 0.015 [], resulting in some bad electrical properties.",

The Pugh's ratio and the Cauchy pressure of both compounds increase with the pressure and brittle to ductile transition occurs at 15 GPa. Both compounds shows semiconducting band structures and our calculated bandgaps by using TB-mBJ potential are in reasonable agreement with experimental and available theoretical values. The density of states increases slightly at the Fermi level with pressure. The Seebeck coefficient at 15 GPa and 600 K in TB-mBJ+SOC calculation for Sr3SbN and Sr3BiN are 257 and 142 μV/K and the corresponding lattice thermal conductivities are 0.11 and 0.06 W/mK, respectively. The lattice thermal conductivity of both compounds decreases with pressure and the predicted figure of merit (ZT) for Sr3SbN and Sr3BiN at 600 K and 15 GPa, are 0.71 and 0.22, respectively. The ZT values for Sr3BiN decreases with temperature and at 300 K it is 0.63. Therefore, both compounds are suitable for thermoelectric device applications due to their ductile nature and high Seebeck coefficient. The calculated power factor (16.5 μWcm−1K−2) for Sr3SbN at 600 K is higher than the value of 10.1μWcm−1K−2 of SnSe single crystals []. The further improvement of thermoelectric performance of the studied materials can be achieved by doping, alloying or nano-structuring. We hope that the predicted results will inspire experimentalist to synthesis these materials at high pressure to realize the possibility in thermoelectric device applications.",

Pristine MnTe is a p-type semiconductor with an average hole concentration of 10^19cm−3. Many dopants like Sodium, Copper and Sulphur were incorporated in the MnTe and their thermoelectric properties were studied. Antimony is an ideal dopant to alter the thermoelectric properties. Compounds belonging to the series Mn1−xSbxTe with (x = 0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.015, 0.02) were prepared using a combination of High Energy Ball Milling (HEBM), melt quenching and hot press techniques. Structural, electrical and thermo-electric properties of these compounds were determined. Carrier concentration and mobility were measured by Hall measurement techniques. Charge carrier concentration increases with Sb doping while mobility and effective mass decreases. Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity were measured in the temperature range 100 K–730 K, and thermal conductivity was evaluated in the temperature range 100 K–300 K. The power factor and figure of merit (ZT) were also estimated. The highest power factor achieved is at 730 K and is 1768μWm−1K−2 for Mn0.98Sb0.02Te. The highlight of the present study is the rise in electrical conductivity and reduction in the thermal conductivity with Sb doping.",

Such a situation can occur when the valence or conduction band of the host semiconductor resonates with the localized impurity energy level. Compared with Na doped PbTe with the same carrier concentration, Tl doped PbTe shows increased effective mass and pronuanced higher Seebeck coefficient. The DOS distortion results in a ZT as high as 1.5 at 773 K, which is very impressive by merely introducing Tl elements in PbTe. The conjunction of this new physical principle with the approaches used to lower the thermal conductivity could further enhance ZT in PbTe system, and have been proved equally applicable in other thermoelectric systems, such as Al-dopd PbSe, such as Al-dopd PbSe and In-doped SnTe systems.",

The green and purple spheres represent Yb and Sb, respectively, and the filled red polyhedron indicates MnSb4 tetrahedron . The molecular weight of Yb14MnSb11 is 3783.088, which is more than ten times higher than that of PbTe (334.8). The electrical resistivity ((b)) increases linearly with temperature and reaches ∼5.4 × 10−3 Ω·cm at 1200 K. The high electrical resistivity corresponds to a low mobility of about 3 cm2/Vs that decreases with temperature. The Seebeck coefficient for Yb14MnSb11 ((c)) reveals a monotonic increase with temperature and reaches a maximum of +185 μV/K at 1275 K. The resulting power factor calculated from the electronic properties exhibits a maximum of ∼6.0 μW/cmK2 at 1200 K, as shown in (d). This value is somewhat low compared with the-state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials . As shown in (e), the thermal conductivity of Yb14MnSb11 is very low, ranging from ∼ 0.7 to 0.9 W/mK from 300 to 1275 K. The low thermal conductivity value is even comparable to a glass, largely owing to the complexity (limiting the phonon mean-free path) and heavy atomic mass (reducing the fraction of atomic vibrational modes that carry heat efficiently) of the crystal. Overall, the ZT for Yb14MnSb11 ((f)) sharply increases with temperature and reaches a maximum of ∼1.0 at 1223 K. Considering the low power factor of Yb14MnSb11, further improvement of the ZT should be possible through carrier concentration optimization .",

                    "context": "As shown in (a), Ag9TlTe5 exhibits a complex hexagonal crystal structure with the space group R-3 c. The hexagonal lattice parameters a = 1.1431 nm and c = 4.1945 nm. The unit cell of Ag9TlTe5 is large and extremely complex, containing 12 molecules and 180 atoms . The electrical resistivity of Ag9TlTe5 decreases with temperature across the whole temperature range, indicating a semiconducting character. The resistivity value at 700 K is 2.63 × 10−2 Ω-cm, (b), which is more than an order of magnitude higher than those of state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials. The Seebeck coefficient first decreases with temperature, reaching a minimum at around 650 K, and then increases with temperature up to 700 K. The Seebeck coefficient value of Ag9TlTe5 at 700 K is 319 μV/K, as shown in (c). The maximum power factor of 3.87 μW/cmK2 was obtained at 700 K, (d). Although its power factor is lower than those of state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials, Ag9TlTe5 exhibits a very high ZT value of 1.23 ((f)) at 700 K because of its extremely low thermal conductivity , whose value at room temperature is about 0.23 W/mK, only one-fifth of that for pure Bi2Te3. The temperature dependence of thermal conductivity is rather weak, as shown in (e), resembling a glass-like limit. To explore the reason behind the low thermal conductivity of Ag9TlTe5, the elastic properties were then characterized. The average sound velocity, Young's modulus, and Debye temperature are 1203 ms−1, 23.4 GPa and 120 K, respectively. These values are very low compared with those of state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials . For example, the Debye temperatures for Bi2Te3 and PbTe are 165 K and 160 K, respectively. The low Young's modulus and Debye temperature of Ag9TlTe5 are attributable to its weak interatomic bonding. The above data well satisfied the requirements for a low thermal conductivity: a large molecular weight, a complex crystal structure, nondirectional bonding, and a large number of different atoms per molecule .",

BiCuSeO exhibits a two-dimensional layered structure, composed of alternatively stacking of fluorite-like Bi2O2 layers and Cu2Se2 layers along c-axis . The combination of low electrical conductivity and large Seebeck coefficient produce a moderate power factor of undoped BiCuSeO, as shown in (b), (c) and 10(d). Considering the intrinsically low thermal conductivity of BiCuSeO ((e)), a practical way to enhance ZT is to increase its electrical transport properties, i.e., the carrier concentration and carrier mobility . The modulation doping, widely used in a 2-dimension film devices to increase carrier mobilities, is very promising to improve the thermoelectric performance for compounds with intrinsically low thermal conductivities; indeed, the introduction of modulation doping in BiCuSeO increases its carrier mobility from 2 to 4 cm2/Vs and decouples the power factor . As shown in (f), the figure of merit ZT was increased from 1.1 to 1.4 at 923 K in BiCuSeO system by modulation doping. The modulation approach prompts the carrier redistribution between the regions with contrasting carrier mobilities, thus facilitating the overall electrical transport. The heterostructures of modulation doped sample make charge carriers preferentially transport in the low carrier concentration area, which increases carrier mobility by a factor of two while maintains the similar overall carrier concentration as that in the uniformly doped sample . The intrinsically low thermal conductivity of BiCuSeO is the main reason for the promising thermoelectric performance in BiCuSeO system, namely, the thermal conductivities of BiCuSeO remain about 0.3–0.5 W/mK throughout the entire temperature range. The elastic properties indicate a Grüneisen parameter of 1.5 in BiCuSeO system , which is impressive for a conductor with moderate electrical transport properties. As in the same V group, Bi owns a larger atom radius than that of Sb, thus it is reasonable to expect that the valence shell and electron clouds surrounding the Bi atoms would be larger than that of Sb . Similarly low lattice thermal conductivity should be observed in the Bi-based compounds, in which the Bi ion formally adopts the trivalent state as Sb in AgSbTe2. The connection between the nature of the bonding and the Grüneisen parameter (γ) has been explored in detail theoretically by Huang et al., who clearly show the effect of large electron",

As discussed above, TiCN has a negative and low Seebeck coefficient instead. Interestingly, similarly to the case of the segregated network in SiAlON, the overall electrical properties of the material are dominated by TiCN which causes the composite to exhibit n-type conductivity and lower Seebeck coefficient. It is worth noting that increasing the amount of TiCN (from 5 to 10 vol.%) does not significantly affect the Seebeck coefficient values. Although the electrical conductivity increases with the addition of TiCN to the system, due to the overall lower Seebeck coefficient values than pure SiC matrix, the PF of the composite is lower than the one of the matrix alone ((e)). One should note that if the amount of TiCN is below 5 vol.% only a partially connecting network might be obtained instead of a percolating one. The lower amount of TiCN results in higher resistivity and, as the TiCN amount does not have significant effects on the Seebeck coefficient, an improved thermoelectric performance cannot be obtained.",

Since then, the number of publications on this family of oxychalcogenides has been increasing steadily. Higher ZT values are found for oxychalcogenides with smaller band gaps. Usually, the temperature at which ZT reaches a maximum value is related to the band gap . This is because for a given band gap energy, there is a temperature at which the onset of intrinsic conduction will occur, and the simultaneous excitation of intrinsic electrons and holes will reduce the Seebeck coefficient (S = Sp + Sn) and hence ZT. It has been shown that, for a given operating temperature T, the optimal thermoelectric performance will be found for semiconductors with a band gap of approximately 10kBT . Bismuth-containing [AO][BQ] phases have significantly lower band gaps than those containing rare earth elements, due to the contribution of Bi 6p states to the bottom of the conduction band . Although the lowest band gap is found for the oxytelluride for which ZT = 0.66 at 673 K, there is a very limited number of doping studies , and most of the effort in optimising the thermoelectric performance has centred on the bismuth oxyselenide. For instance, high values of the thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT, have been obtained by doping with divalent (Sr2+, Ca2+, Pb2+, Mg2+) or monovalent cations (Na+, K+) . Alternatively, p-type doping can be achieved by introducing vacancies at the copper site, which leads to a ZT value of 0.81 at 923 K for BiOCu0.975Se . In addition, the thermal conductivity of Ba2+ doped BiOCuSe could be decreased by approximately 40% when reducing the grain sizes down to 200–400 nm, resulting in an even higher ZT value of 1.1 at 923 K . Similar reductions in thermal conductivity have been found for ball milled BiOCuSe , suggesting that nanostructuring may be an effective approach to enhance the thermoelectric response of these materials. The highest figure of merit, ZT ∼1.4 (at 923 K), seems to have been achieved through the introduction of texture in Bi0.875Ba0.125OCuSe by hot forging . More recently, dual vacancies at the bismuth and the copper site have been exploited to reduce the thermal conductivity and control the charge",

                    "context": "It has been found that Group IIIA elements have a potential to control the carrier type and carrier concentration in PbSe . For example, the addition of thallium (Tl) in PbSe shows a p-type nature. Properties of PbSe do not increase drastically with incorporation of Tl because it cannot be doped while melting . It has been observed that with increasing Tl dopant concentration electrical conductivity of PbSe increases, but Seebeck coefficient and power factor decrease drastically . Also by Tl doping, there is some band modification near the Fermi level of PbSe causing reduction of Seebeck coefficient and power factor. It has been observed that high density of state, effective mass, and Hall carrier mobility decrease electrical conductivity of Tl doped PbSe causing low Seebeck coefficient and power factor. 0.01 wt% of Tl doped PbSe shows maximum Seebeck coefficient of 248 μV/K at 723 K. The highest zT and power factor of the same composition at 723 K are ∼1 and 0.98 mW/m.K2. For some composition (0.01 wt%) of Tl doped PbSe at room temperature, Seebeck coefficient, zT and power factor are 82.80 μV/K, 0.05 and 0.27, respectively. The decrease in thermal conductivity is governed by the phonon scattering effect. Tl3+ ion is heavier than Pb2+ and it results in stronger phonon scattering as well as there is some increased mid to long range phonon scattering due to the increase of boundary scattering .",

The significant roles of MgTe in enhancing electrical properties and reducing thermal conductivity of PbTe0.8Se0.2 were investigated. A maximum zT of ∼2.2 at 820 K was achieved in PbTe0.8Se0.2 with 8% MgTe. Subsequently, a large dimension bulk (∼200 g, Φ42 mm × 18 mm) was fabricated and its homogeneity and the repeatability of high zT values were determined. The results show that high zT ∼2.0 can also be achieved even in such a large sample. These results highlight the multi-functional roles of quaternary alloying with Mg and Se, and demonstrate the realistic prospect of large-scale commercial fabrication in high performance PbTe-based thermoelectric materials.",

It is found that the power factor is increased by 15% and the lattice thermal conductivity is reduced by 20% at 800 K. A maximum zT of ∼2.2 is obtained at 820 K for the sample of Mg0.08Pb0.92Te0.8Se0.2 with 2% Na doping. Furthermore, the sample was magnified up to ∼200 g in weight.

In this work we carefully investigated thermoelectric properties of the In-Hg co-doped SnTe, synthesized by a hot pressing method. With this co-doping the Seebeck coefficients of the co-doped samples were greatly improved (over 50 μVK−1) at the room temperature. Although power factors of the In-Hg co-doped SnTe were also able to be optimized, the peak ZT (0.9 at 850 K in Sn0.98Bi0.02Te-1%HgInTe2), however, is not high enough when comparing to other co-doped SnTe systems. This may be caused by the relatively high lattice thermal conductivity. An apparent competition between band convergence doping and resonant level doping was observed in our experiment. The results suggest that band engineering via co-doping should be further understood in order to optimize the thermoelectric properties inside the material system.",

ZM Bi2Te3-based alloys are mainly used in the solid-state refrigeration because of high zT values of ∼1 near room temperature []. With the increasing energy consumption, Bi2Te3 based alloys have drawn increasing interest for power generation applications below 700 K. P-type Bi2Te3-based alloys for this purpose have exhibited high TE performance. For example, Hu et al. obtained a high zT of ∼1.3 at 380 K for p-type polycrystalline Bi0.3Sb1.7Te3 alloys [] and a maximum zT of ∼0.92 at 710 K for p-type Ag0.01Sb1.85In0.15Te3 alloy []. Xu et al. successfully upshifted the service temperature of p-type (Bi,Sb)2Te3, and a peak value of zT of ∼1.4 was attained at 500 K in Bi0.3Sb1.625In0.075Te3 []. As for n-type Bi2Te3-based alloys for power generation, Pan et al. fabricated textured n-type Bi2(Te,Se)3 materials with a maximum zT exceeding 1.1 at 473 K []; Wang et al. reported a peak zT value of ∼0.86 at 600 K in n-type zone melted Bi2Te1.5Se1.5 []; Meanwhile, Liu et al. achieved a high zT of ∼0.8 at 573 K in n-type Bi2Te2S prepared by ball-milling and hot-pressing []. However, the current n-type performance cannot match the p-type counterparts in the range of 500–700 K. Therefore, this work is focused on high performance n-type Bi2Te3-based alloys for power generation at higher temperatures.",

Among these compounds, Fe2VAl has attracted intense attention because there is a deep, well-developed pseudogap about 0.1–0.2 eV near the Fermi level, which is highly unusual for intermetallic compounds . This characteristic makes Fe2VAl show semiconductor-like behavior in electrical transport . In recent years, Fe2VAl-based alloys have been investigated widely as a promising thermoelectric compound because semiconductors with a narrow band-gap are inclined to have good thermoelectric performance . Investigations on the low temperature transport between 10 and 300 K of Fe2−xV1+xAl (0 ≤\nx\n≤ 0.11) revealed that the thermoelectric property is greatly affected by Fe and V contents . The Seebeck coefficient of Fe2VAl at room temperature is about 40 V/K. When Fe was replaced by V, the conduction shifted from p-type to n-type, while the Seebeck coefficient and low-temperature electrical conductivity increased sharply . Other research showed that the Seebeck coefficient of Fe2VAl was also sensitive to Al content . The Seebeck coefficient shifted from −130 to 75 V/K with the deviation of the Al content in (Fe2/3V1/3)100−yAly (23.8 ≤\ny\n≤ 25.8) alloys . Besides, the effects of Ge substitution and Si substitution for Al site were also reported by Nishino et al. and Lue et al. , respectively. The Fe2VAl1−xGex (0 ≤\nx\n≤ 0.20) and Fe2VAl1−xSix (0 ≤\nx\n≤ 0.50) alloys were synthesized by arc-melting and the results showed that Ge or Si substituting for Al site could dramatically enhance the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity, leading to a rather large power factor at room temperature. Recently, the Fe2VAl alloy with fine microstructure was synthesized by mechanical alloying and pulse-current sintering, exhibiting an improved ZT value . Furthermore, the thermoelectric properties of (Fe1−xCox)2TiAl and p-type (Fe2−xCox)(V1−yTiy)Al alloys were also studied, which showed that the Co is a promising substituting element for Fe2VAl system . However, the systematical effect of Co substitution for Fe2VAl remains a key issue for the thermoelectric property of Fe2VAl. For Fe2VAl-based alloys, tuning the electrical transport is a key approach to improve the thermoelectric property and it is also crucial to further reduce the thermal conductivity in order to achieve higher ZT value.",

Recently, a high zT (1.86 at 320 K) was reported in (Bi0.25Sb0.75)2Te3 as a result of thermal conductivity reduction by phonon engineering through dislocations . In addition to the reduced thermal conductivity, excess Te and relatively low hole concentration probably leads to charge carrier optimization of the electronic properties as well. The maximum attainable electronic performance of a thermoelectric material is proportional to the quality factor , which in turn depends on the number of Fermi pockets (Nv) . Because Nv is not coupled to any other property related to zT, converging separate carrier pockets provides a straightforward strategy for improving zT. While previous experiments on (Bi1−xSbx)2Te3 assumed single band behaviour when describing the electronic properties, we show that convergence of multiple bands is a viable improvement strategy in this system as well.",

Subsequent research has demonstrated that nanostructuring with Bi2S3 (given as the dotted green line in a) results in an additional ∼30% reduction of the lattice thermal conductivity for n-type PbS0.98Cl0.02. Further introduction of mesostructures (given for n-type and p-type variants respectively as the dotted and solid red lines in a) led to an additional suppression of lattice thermal conductivity by ∼40% and ∼25% for p-type Pb0.975Na0.025S-SrS and n-type PbS0.98Cl0.02-Bi2S3, respectively. Overall, these efforts increased the ZT values to ∼1.2 and ∼1.1 at 923 K for p-type Pb0.975Na0.025S-3%SrS and n-type PbS0.98Cl0.02–1% Bi2S3, respectively, as depicted in b.",

However, the thermoelectric property of pristine CoSbS is very low due to its low carrier concentration (n ~ 10^17 cm−3) and relatively high thermal conductivity (9.59 W m−1 K−1) . In the past several years, most investigations have focused on optimizing the carrier concentration of the material by doping with Ni, Zn and Se to improve its thermoelectric performance. Our previous investigation shows that Se doping on the S site modified the electronic band configuration where it shrinks the band gap and decreases the activation energy of the impurity states. Additionally, Z. Liu et al. doped Ni on the Co site of CoSbS increasing the carrier concentration. As a result, large power factor of 20 μW cm−1 K−2 at 873 K is attained in Ni doped Co1-xNixSbS. However, due to the enhanced magnetic scattering, the carrier mobility sharply decreases upon Ni doping. Therefore exploring some nonmagnetic dopant in CoSbS is urgent for further improvement of the thermoelectric properties of CoSbS.",

Rational tensile stress and annealing treatment can significantly enhance the power factor of the high-performance Bi2Te3 TE fibers. The resulting undoped Bi2Te3 cores exhibit a power factor of 1.32 mW m−1 K−2 and a ZT of ∼0.76 at 300 K. And the TE fiber cup generator covered with Bi2Te3 TE fibers reaches a power of 0.47 μW under ΔT = 19 K. Tensile stress tuning from the physical mechanism of thermal size reduction can be an effective tool for the layered chalcogenide materials optimization at band structures and thermoelectric properties.",

S increased almost linearly with decreasing temperature down to about 170 K, reached a maximum at about 130 K and dropped to zero at about 100 K. The observed temperature dependence is a characteristic of the in-plane TEP for optimally doped HTSC . On the other hand, both the absolute value and the temperature dependence of S differ greatly from those for optimally doped La-214. For example, S at 290 K is 40 μV/K in La1.85Sr0.15CuO4. Accordingly it is likely that the anomalous behavior of TEP in La-214 is not due to its structure with a single CuO2 layers but due to a phenomenon specific to La-214 such as the stripe order of spin and charge .",

Carrier concentration decreased with increasing In content because In filled Sn vacancies and excessive In atoms substituted Ge because of the solubility limit of GeTe. Consequently, p-type carrier concentration increased again. This phenomenon to similar to that observed in In-doped SnTe in a previous study. The Seebeck coefficients for Ge1-xInxTe (x\n= 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04) compounds are presented in b. The Seebeck coefficients of all the samples were positive and showed p-type transport with holes dominating the free carrier concentration. All the doped samples had higher Seebeck coefficients than pure GeTe due to the distortion of DOS near the Fermi level; the room-temperature Seebeck coefficient of 1% In-doped GeTe sample is 59 μV/K, which is higher than that of the undoped GeTe sample (28 μV/K). However, Seebeck coefficient decreased at high doping content due to the solubility limit of GeTe and carrier concentration. The expanding band gap contributed to the improvement of the Seebeck coefficient at high temperatures and suppressed the bipolar effect. These findings were also obtained in a previous work. c shows the temperature dependence of the PF of Ge1-xInxTe (x\n= 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04). PF increased from 31.5 μWcm−1\nK−2 in pure GeTe to 39.5 μWcm−1\nK−2 in Ge0.97In0.03Te at 773 K originating from the resonant states while In-doped GeTe has a higher carrier concentration. Meanwhile, the bipolar effect was suppressed.",

Ga atoms can fill the icosahedron cages of skutterudite at high temperature, but at low temperature, they are driven out from the lattice voids and form the second phase of GaSb at grain boundaries. The presence of GaSb second phases reduces the thermal conductivity effectively. Te doping leads to a significant increase in carrier concentration of Ga0.2Co4Sb11.3Te, thus largely suppresses the bipolar effect of GaxCo4Sb12.3, resulting in a great enhancement in power factor. Moreover, Te doping induces mass and strain fluctuation, which decreases the lattice thermal conductivity further. Consequently, the maximum ZT is increased from 0.56 for Ga0.2Co4Sb12.3 at 573 K to 1.48 for Ga0.2Co4Sb11.3Te at 873 K, which is advantageous to improve the thermoelectric conversion efficiency for commercial application.",

The formation of uniformly distributed GaSb nano-dispersions in n-type filled skutterudite was realized by controlling the metastable Ga fillers through a proper annealing process. As a result, the highest ZT of 0.56 was achieved at 623 K for Ga0.2Co4Sb12.3, which was ∼3 times that of CoSb3 at 610 K [] and was also ∼3 times that of Ga0.25Co4Sb12 prepared by conventional quenching method []. Furthermore, with the significantly increase of carrier concentration caused by Te-doping, the bipolar effect of Ga-filled skutterudite was enormously suppressed, which led to a great decrease in thermal conductivity and a great increase in power factor of Ga0.2Co4Sb11.3Te. The thermal conductivity of Ga0.2Co4Sb11.3Te was ∼2.8 Wm−1K−1 at 873 K, which was 30% lower than that of Ga0.2Co4Sb12.3, and the power factor enhanced to ten times, which increased from ∼5 × 10−4 Wm−1K−2 for Ga0.2Co4Sb12.3 to 50 × 10−4 Wm−1K−2 for Ga0.2Co4Sb11.3Te. As a result, the thermoelectric properties of Ga0.2Co4Sb11.3Te were effectively improved over the whole temperature range studied, and the highest ZT of 1.48 was achieved.",

The ZT values at temperatures lower than 675 K almost not change with the increase of Te content. But when the temperature is higher than 675 K, the ZT value increases with increasing Te content due to the enhancement of the suppressed bipolar effect. (a) shows the temperature-dependent electrical conductivity of GaxCo4Sb12.3 (x = 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25). The electrical conductivity of GaxCo4Sb12.3 samples rises rapidly with temperature until it reaches the extreme value (e.g. 286.69 S cm−1 at 473 K for Ga0.2Co4Sb12.3), then tends to be flat, and rises again when the temperature is higher than 600 K, which is characterized by intrinsic excitation. As Ga contents increase, the electrical conductivity increases until the filling fraction (x) of Ga increases to 0.2, indicating that Ga filling is almost saturated at x = 0.2. With some Te doping, the electrical conductivity improves significantly, which increases from 208 S cm−1 for Ga0.2Co4Sb12.3 to 1281 S cm−1 for Ga0.2Co4Sb11.3Te at room temperature ((b)). The excellent electrical performance of Ga0.2Co4Sb11.3Te comes from the substitution of a portion of Sb atoms by Te atoms with more outer electrons, which enhances the carrier concentration largely. The enhanced carrier concentration is also proved by room-temperature Hall effect measurements of Ga0.2Co4Sb12.3 and Ga0.2Co4Sb11.3Te samples, as shown in ",

Benefiting from the increased power factor and the decreased thermal conductivity, the Ga0.2Co4Sb11.3Te sample exhibits superior thermoelectric performance than the Ga0.2Co4Sb12.3 sample in the whole temperature range studied. Since the increased Eg () and carrier concentration suppress the bipolar effect of the Ga0.2Co4Sb12.3 sample at 573 K, it is obvious that the temperature corresponding to the maximum ZT shifts gradually from lower to higher temperature between Ga0.2Co4Sb12.3 and Ga0.2Co4Sb11.3Te. And the maximum ZT of 1.48 is achieved for the Ga0.2Co4Sb11.3Te sample at 873 K, which is almost three times that of Ga0.2Co4Sb12.3.

It found that Ga atoms can fill the icosahedron cages of GaxCo4Sb12.3 at high temperature but driven out of the lattice voids at low temperature to form the second phase of GaSb at grain boundaries. Te doping can suppress the bipolar effect of GaxCo4Sb12.3 effectively by increasing the carrier concentration, resulting in largely enhanced power factor and reduced thermal conductivity in Ga0.2Co4Sb11.3Te in the whole temperature range studied, especially at temperatures over 600 K. As a result, the highest ZT of 0.56 for Ga0.2Co4Sb12.3 at 573 K is greatly improved to 1.48 for Ga0.2Co4Sb11.3Te at 873 K, which is meaningful for the enhancement of thermoelectric conversion efficiency for commercial application.",

Due to the band convergence effect induced by alloying with MnTe as evidenced from our DFT calculations, it is clearly shown that a higher MnTe concentration leads to a stronger Seebeck coefficient enhancement. This result provides a clear evolution on solid solution reducing the band offset in SnTe, and shows a good agreement with the above mentioned temperature dependent Hall coefficient measurements (a). Furthermore, when back dope the Sn0.85Mn0.15Te solid solution with iodine to obtain different carrier concentrations , all the resulting materials show a Seebeck coefficient well above the Pisarenko line (Hall carrier concentration dependent Seebek coefficient) that predicted based on a two band model . More quantitatively, the obtained room temperature Seebeck coefficient of ∼60 μV/K in Sn0.85Mn0.15Te alloys, is about four times increased as compared with SnTe (∼15 μV/K). a also shows a detailed comparison on the Seebeck coefficient with available literatures in SnTe solid solution with band convergence effect. It is shown the Seebeck coefficient enhancement obtained in Sn0.85Mn0.15Te is much more significant than any other ever reported, suggesting a better band alignment that can be expected from the higher solubility of MnTe (∼15%). This band convergence resulted Seebeck coefficient enhancement persists to higher temperatures as shown in b.",

The calculated Lorenz numbers for different Te contents have been shown in . On the basis of the κele obtained in , the κlat is thus achieved and plotted in (b), revealing a systemic reduction over the measured temperature range due to the effect of temperature rise on the lattice vibration. As is well known, the BiCuSeO-based materials possess intrinsically low thermal conductivity, which originates from its unique natural superlattice structure and weak bonding between layers []. Zhao et al. had attempted to calculate minimum lattice thermal conductivity using the minimum interatomic distance (d = lPh, ∼3 Å) as the phonon mean free path (PMFP), which is the κlat,min of 0.47 W m−1K−1 at 300 K for the BiCuSeO system []. It is much lower than our κlat values at initial temperature for pristine and Te-doped BiCuSeO, suggesting that a further reduction in κlat is feasible using rational optimization. In addition, we notice that the lattice thermal conductivity exhibits a decrease and then an increase with Te contents, which may be attributed to the typical microstructures and the competitive effects of lattice disorder and changed PMFP induced by Te substitution. The microstructural features of BiCuSe0.9Te0.1O are investigated again to seek the probable reason of lower lattice thermal conductivity. As shown in , the abundant structural modulations can be readily observed in the same area, which are known as an evidence for the presence of interior strain [], inducing the production of atomic-scale defects to promote the scatter of phonons. Additionally, with increasing Te contents, the interatomic distance as PMFP will obviously increase due to the weaker electronegativity and larger atomic radius of Te, leading to the weakened phonon scattering becoming dominant, and then a slight enhancement in κlat for heavier Te-doped BiCuSeO system.",

The graph clearly shows that S is positive at all temperatures, confirming a conduction mechanism mainly produced by holes. The values of the Seebeck coefficient increase with temperature, and display the same vales for all the samples. This behaviour can be explained when considering the very small contribution of TiC to the S values of these samples . Consequently, the total S values, which have been measured in these samples are only due to the Ca3Co4O9 contribution, and it is the same for all of them. The highest S value has been determined at 800 °C (around 195 μV/K) is higher than the best values reported for pure Ca3Co4O9 samples sintered and textured by spark plasma sintering (170–175 μV/K) . On the other hand, it is lower than the measured in highly dense materials prepared through alternative methods (205 μV/K) .",

MnTe possesses a large Seebeck coefficient and a low thermal conductivity, but a huge electrical resistivity makes MnTe be an inferior thermoelectric material. To improve the poor electrical resistivity of MnTe, J. Y. Yang et al. found that Cu is an effective dopant that could increase the hole concentration and boost the electrical conductivity of MnTe . A promising maximum ZT of 0.55 was achieved in the Mn0.925Cu0.075Te sample at 773 K, which is improved by 35% in comparison to the undoped MnTe.",

For pristine SnSe, σ firstly increases with increasing temperature, then turns to decrease at ∼450 K but finally increases above 650 K. This trend is also found in previous reports, which can be ascribed to amixed scattering mechanism of carrier transport by acoustic phonon and grain boundary potential barrier [,]. Compared to pure SnSe, the electrical conductivities of Te-doped samples have been greatly enhanced, especially around room temperature. The maximum electrical conductivity of 98.4 S/cm for the sample SnSe0.8Te0.2 is obtained at 300 K. This value is significantly higher than those reported in other polycrystalline SnSe [,,].",

                    "context": "In this context, the coexistence of complex magnetic structure  and ferroelectricity  in the delafossite structure CuFeO2 is very interesting. In this compound crystallizing in the R3̄m space group, the FeO6 octahedra layers are isostructural to the CoO6 layer of the NaxCoO2 system . The main difference lies in the separating layer with a linear coordination of monovalent copper, since the O–Cu–O bridges ensure the connection between successive FeO2 planes. The presence of high spin (S=5/2) at the B-site of the AFeO2 delafossite together with the triangular spin frustration creates complex antiferromagnetic states, coupled to structural transitions, with modulations of the magnetic structure linked to ferroelectricity . However, the very stable high spin configuration of Fe3+, precluding the possibility to induce electrical conductivity, is in marked contrast with the low electrical resistivity reported for the chromium based analogous delafossite, CuCr1−xMgxO2. The CuCrO2 compound is clearly insulating and its magnetic structure, established by neutron diffraction data refinements, revealed a complex antiferromagnetic incommensurate structure with a short magnetic correlation length along c and a maximal magnetic moment of ∼3μB. Clear evidence for magnetic ordering below TN is provided by specific heat measurements as well, for both undoped and Mg-doped samples , the former being also a multiferroic . However, the electrical resistivity drop induced by the Mg2+ for Cr3+ substitution and its relation to the structural properties has not yet been clearly elucidated. The values of the transport coefficients show discrepancies, too. Indeed, according to Ono et al. , the resistivity of CuCr0.98Mg0.02O2 at room temperature (RT) is about 1 Ω cm, while according to Okuda et al. it is rather one order of magnitude smaller . Regarding the thermopower at room temperature, the former authors reported a value around 280 μV/K whereas the latter obtained 100 μV/K. Besides, some authors mentioned a hole creation at the A site by charge compensation, Cu+1−xCu2+xCr3+1−xMg2+xO2, whereas others considered a mixed valency Cr3+/Cr4+ according to Cu+Cr3+1−2xCr4+xMg2+xO2. For all these reasons the CuCr1−xMgxO2 system has been revisited.",

The low ZT values are likely due to the anisotropic TE properties of SnSe single crystals (low ZT of 0.8 along the a-axis). One way to improve ZT values is by maximizing the texturing in SnSe polycrystals during the preparation stage, where the typical sintering process would not fulfil this purpose in bulk-scale materials–,. To improve TE properties at temperatures below ~800 K, different dopants for SnSe have been explored. For example, Na doped SnSe single crystal was reported to exhibit ZT ranging from 0.7 to 2.0 at 300 K to 773 K. However, doping is less effective for SnSe polycrystals because polycrystals have less texturing and form defects easily, which can degrade the electrical properties–––.",

The highest power factor of p-type SnSe thin films reached 4.27 μWcm-1 K-2 at 550 K, higher than reported values of SnSe single crystals. Such high TE performances of the solution-processed SnSe thin film were achieved by the synergistic effect of textured microstructure, controlled compositions, and film continuity, which were realized through the non-hydrazine synthesis of molecular SnSe-based chalcogenidometallate (ChaM) and the controlled transition from a two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide SnSe2 phase to a SnSe phase.",

Reduction of unfilled SBN single crystals showed that NbO2 preferentially forms on the surface perpendicular to the c-axis. The electrical conductivity of NbO2 was reported to be 40 S/cm at about 650 K. Since SBN has a higher conductivity along the c-axis, the nucleation of more resistive NbO2 at the c-axis surface could potentially affect the conduction across grain boundaries in ceramic samples. The conductivity of NbO2 as reported by Janninck et al. increases drastically at higher temperatures to ~250 S/cm at 1000 K and ~500 S/cm at ~1300 K. The abrupt increase in conductivity in NbO2 may also explain why the conductivity of unfilled SBN at higher temperatures falls off less slowly than the filled SBN as shown in Fig. 4.",

At 1000 K, the electrical resistivity and the Seebeck coefficient of the single crystal Ca3Co4O9 are about 0.9 mΩ cm and 280 µV/K, respectively, which makes the ZT get to 0.8, very close to 1, that is considered as the lower limit for the practical use. Unfortunately, the large bulk of Ca3Co4O9 single crystal is difficult to prepare. Therefore, the researchers have to pay more attention to preparing polycrystalline Ca3Co4O9 ceramics and improving their thermoelectric performances. In past years, the way to enhance the thermoelectric performance of Ca3Co4O9 ceramics was related to these methods: (1) doping in Ca site or Co site to adjust carrier concentration to optimize Seebeck coefficient or electrical resistivity, (2) micro-structure controlled for achieving high level textured materials to increase the conductivities and Seebeck coefficient, (3) nano-structured for increasing the density of state of the carrier to improve the Seebeck coefficient, and reducing photon contribution to the thermal conductivity, (4) introducing the second phase for preparing the composites to optimize the thermoelectric parameters based on the mixing laws.",

SiGe alloys were considered as potential thermoelectric materials for their wide energy gaps and low thermal conductivities. The physical properties were found to be closely dependent on the compositions of the alloys. Hence, composition adjustment could be practiced in an attempt to manipulate the performances of SiGe alloys. Conventional dopants (B, P, GaP, AlP, etc) were reported to be useful in tailoring the figure of merit (ZT). For example, the p-type SiGe alloys applied to radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) were reported to have a peak ZT ~0.5 (at 850 °C). The peak of ZT has reached 0.95 (at 800 °C) in p-type nanostructured SiGe bulk alloys. Being the promising dopant, rare earth, has frequently been reported to play an important role in enhancing ZT of other thermoelectric materials, but less so in SiGe alloys. Gibbons’ group found that the deep-donor-like centers most probably were produced by rare earth impurities in Tm- and Nd-doped Si crystals. The Tm and Yb dopants exhibited as deep donors in the Si lattice, but were of little use due to the low solubilities. It is therefore believed that, adding rare earth elements to the bulk SiGe alloys could have similar effects on improving their comprehensive properties. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of small amount of Er addition on the transport properties of Si80Ge20B0.6 alloys, among which particular focus was placed on its influences on the electrical performance since significant enhancement of the carrier concentration was observed.",

The lowest thermal conductivity is observed to be ~0.5 W m-1 K at 793 K in Sn0.98Ag0.04Se. The ZT values are calculated from the measured properties and are plotted in Figure 3d. Due to better electrical properties, Sn0.99Ag0.02Se shows higher ZT values than Sn0.98Ag0.04Se and undoped SnSe. The highest ZT in Sn0.99Ag0.02Se is found to be over 0.9 at 793 K, which is higher than the reported values in polycrystalline SnSe materials.,,,, However, this value is still smaller than that of the Ag-doped SnSe SC (1.2).",

The ZT along ab direction is evidently exceeds that along c direction due to the higher electrical conductivity. The maximum figure of merit (ZT) of 0.35 is obtained for BiTeBr specimen at 560 K. It is possible to reach a higher peak ZT if the measurement temperature is increased further. However, given the possible thermal instability, this does not extend to higher temperatures. Although Cl alloying in BiTeBr lowers the thermal conductivity, it results in a deterioration in the electrical properties and does not contribute to improving the TE performance. To further enhance ZT of BiTeBr, reducing the carrier concentration to further enhance the power factor is a promising way. Furthermore, isoelectronic alloying by using Sb could be another effective way to suppress the lattice thermal conductivity and thus improve the TE performance.",

The room temperature power factor is ~25 µW cm-1 K-2 and the peak power factor reaches ~40 µW cm-1 K-2 for ZrCoBi0.80Sn0.20. In addition, Sn-doped TiCoSb and ZrCoSb (both were prepared in this work with identical approach) with similar Hall carier concentration are also ploted for comparison. As shown in Fig. 3c, ZrCoBi0.75Sn0.15 and ZrCoBi0.80Sn0.20 show noticeably higher power factors than that of Sn-doped ZrCoSb and TiCoSb. Band-degeneracy-dependent power factor at different temperatures is further plotted for the three compounds, as shown in Fig. 3d. The power factor increases monotonically with the band degeneracy at all of the temperatures. This unambiguously demonstrates that band degeneracy plays a pivotal role in the power factor. In other words, the high power factor achieved in ZrCoBi-based compounds should be mainly ascribed to the high band degeneracy for this compound as indicated by the theoretical calculations (Fig. 2b).",

At room temperature, when the Pb doping content x is less than 0.08, the thermal conductivity of the out-of-plane direction for Bi2Te3Pbx is comparable to that of the undoped Bi2Te3. However, a different effect was found with increasing temperature. For the undoped Bi2Te3, the thermal conductivity rapidly and monotonously increases when the temperature is above 323 K. However, the thermal conductivity of Bi2Te3Pbx first decreases monotonously and then slowly increases at elevated temperature. In addition, the higher the content of Pb doping, the slower the increase. The thermal conductivity for Bi2Te3Pbx decreased remarkably after Pb doping compared with the undoped Bi2Te3 at elevated temperature, especially when the dopant content x equals to 0.08. For the undoped Bi2Te3, the κ increases from the minimum value of 1.28 W m- 1 K- 1 at 300 K to 2.09 W m- 1 K- 1 at 503 K. The κ of the Pb0.08 sample reaches the minimum value of 0.87 W m- 1 K- 1 at 423 K and only increases to 0.96 W m- 1 K- 1 at 503 K. The κ of the Pb0.08 sample has been reduced by about 54% compared with the undoped Bi2Te3 at 503 K.",

This is attributed to its excellent chemical and thermal stability at high temperatures, as well as superior electrical properties through elemental doping, nontoxic components and abundant natural resources. However, when phonons develop from the lattice vibrations and transport through the material, an orderly structure with insufficient defects results in a large mean phonon path lph, further restraining the intrinsic scattering mechanism. As we see in Figure 1a, different such as PGEC (phonon glass - electron crystal) materials characterised by very complex crystal structures and heavy atom compaction, the simple wurtzite structure of ZnO contains only two light elements and leads to less atom mass. Even if it has covalent properties—the electronegativities of Zn and O are 1.65 and 3.44, respectively—ionic bonds still dominate the whole material. Due to the strong interaction of ionic bonds and covalent bonds, phonons can transport between the crystal lattice with mostly harmonic vibration, and therefore the thermal conductivity of ZnO remains high during scattering processes with κL over 40 W m-1 K-1 at room temperature, as Keyes mentioned. When the crystal structure changes from wurtzite binary ZnO to perovskite ternary compound CaMnO3, the ABO3 structure (Figure 1b) was more complex and multi-octahedral or tetrahedral intervals made spaces for other elements, even doping locations could increase to three, and the TE properties of CaMnO3 substituted at A and/or B sites have been widely investigated—they have been found to depend on their preferable electrical performance. Furthermore, complex crystal structure made the intrinsic thermal conductivity of CaMnO3 reduce to only 3.6 W m-1 K-1 at room temperature when compared with ZnO, and, similar to ZnO, CaMnO3 has strong covalent or ionic bonds of Mn–O, O–O and Ca–O; lack of weak linkages between atoms would limit the further decrease of κL value.",

For the pure Cu1.8S sample, the σ was initially 3560 S/cm and decreased to 1220 S/cm with increasing temperature, showing a turning point of the σ. The appearance of the turning point at 373 K for the pure Cu1.8S, which was sintered at 773 K, can be explained by the phase change, where Cu ion positions were changed. For the Sn0.03Cu1.77S and Sn0.05Cu1.75S samples, the values of the σ were initially 401 S/cm and 405 S/cm, respectively, due to the main phase of them is Cu1.8S (as shown in Fig. 1), the temperature dependences of the transport behavior is similar to the pure Cu1.8S sample. However, because of the second phase and nano pores scattering the value of the samples x = 0.03 and x = 0.05 are much lower than that of pure Cu1.8S sample. The σ decreased to 33–74 S/cm, 19–96 S/cm in the whole temperature range for the x = 0.005, 0.01, respectively, due to the main phase of them is Cu1.96S (as shown in Fig. 1), the temperature dependences of the transport behavior are similar with the pure Cu1.96S sample. The two samples x = 0.03 and x = 0.05 have a relatively high σ due to the high electrical impurities of Cu1.8S and Cu4SnS4. Cu4SnS4 is a p-type semiconductor with an σ of 70 S/cm at room temperature. The x = 0.01 sample got the lowest electrical conductivity (19 S/cm) because of the low σ of Cu1.96S matrix and the second phase of Cu2SnS3. Cu2SnS3 has been reported as a solar energy material with an σ of 0.5 S/cm. Table I shows carrier concentration and carrier mobility of all SnxCu1.8-xS bulk samples at room temperature. With the increasing Sn concentration, the carrier concentration of the bulk samples decreased due to increased impure contents. However, the mobility of the samples linearly increases with increasing Sn contents due to the increased Cu vacancies. In this work, we supposed that the Sn will occupy the Cu site, the Cu content was therefore reduced when preparing the sample. But the Sn become the second phases and leaving the increased Cu vacancies with increasing Sn content. Cu1.8S is a kind of superionic conductor in which Cu ions have a large mobility in the lattice as in liquid electrolytes and the main carrier is",

Among them, Mg3Sb2 with a low density of ~4.0 g cm-3 shows an intrinsically low room-temperature κL of about 1.0–1.5 W m-1 K-1,, comparable to those of the state-of-the-art TE materials PbTe and Bi2Te3., A small difference (~15%) in κL is found between single crystalline and polycrystalline Mg3Sb2 samples,, suggesting that the grain boundary scattering does not play a significant role in phonon transport. Though alloying is often applied to further reducing lattice thermal conductivity through point defect scattering, the intrinsically low thermal conductivity induced by the phonon–phonon scattering is indispensable to the exceptionally high zT in n-type Mg3Sb2-based materials. Below we will discuss the origin of the intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity in Mg3Sb2 from first principles.",

In conjunction with the experimental observations, atomistic simulations have been performed to investigate the anisotropic behavior of the lattice thermal conductivity. The ceramics show promising n-type thermoelectric properties with relatively high Seebeck coefficient, moderate electrical conductivity, and temperature-stable, low thermal conductivity; For example, the composition with x = 0.27 (i.e., Ba5.19Nd8.54Ti18O54) exhibited a Seebeck coefficient of S1000K = 210 µV/K, electrical conductivity of σ1000K = 60 S/cm, and thermal conductivity of k1000K = 1.45 W/(m K), leading to a ZT value of 0.16 at 1000 K.",

One of the materials with high thermoelectric performance is Ca–Al–Sb discovered by Toberer et al.. After this discovery, it is pointed out that Ca-Al-Sb alloys with different stoichiometry have also high thermoelectric performance. For example, Seebeck coefficient of Ca5Al2Sb6 is larger than 450 μV/K at room temperature. The other is Ca3AlSb3 which possesses the Seebeck coefficient almost 200 μV/K at room temperature. In the Sr3GaSb3 obtained by modifying the Ca3AlSb3 system, the Seebeck coefficient is around 200 μV/K. Different elements, such as Zn, Mn, Yb, Eu, Ga, In, as etc., were partially doped/substituted to improve the thermoelectric performance of the systems.",

                    "context": "Conventionally, p-type Si-Ge alloys have been used as building blocks in TE cells, exhibiting ZT900 K). Several new structures and materials have also been explored recently. For example, Yb14MnSb11 has revealed a promising increase of both ZT (185 µV/K at 1275 K) and Seebeck’s coefficient (S) (1.0 at 1275 K), the latter having twice the value obtained from Si-Ge alloys. By reducing the thermal conductivity and optimizing carrier concentration in bulk materials, the above approaches have demonstrated high ZT of 1.25—at high temperatures around 900 K—and maximum S of 200 μV/K. Following this approach, Ba8Ga16Ge30 alloy has been shown to have ZT of 1.35 at 900 K, and an extrapolated ZT up to 1.63 at 1100 K is predicted, with S of 45 and 300 μV/K measured at 300 and 900 K, respectively. Both, p- and n-type semiconductor materials with different structures have been investigated for high-temperature TE applications. The p-type TE materials have shown promising results (e.g. p-type Bi2Te3/Sb2Te3 superlattices exhibiting a ZT of 2.4 at 300 K and S of 243 μV/K) compared to n-type (e.g. n-type Bi2Te3/Bi2Te2.83Se0.17 showing a ZT below 1.4 at 300 K). Chalcogenide compounds such as Cs1-xRbxBi4Te, have also been used as TE materials for near-/mid-room-temperature applications, e.g. showing a ZT above 1.5 and a S of 100 μV/K at low temperatures around 160 K. Despite excellent advances the performance of above bulk and thin film materials falls short of the requirements for wider nano- and micro-electronic systems.",

For small temperature gradients (i.e. < 20 K), the nanostructures are likely to have better ZT compared to their counterpart based on the bulk and thin film materials. This makes them promising candidates as energy harvesters for self-powered wearable systems on flexible substrates. The NWs-based superlattices, InSb quantum-dot structures, Si NWs, single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) bundle, BiTe NWs and a GaAs NWs, are predicted to have better thermoelectric properties than bulk and thin film materials. For example, ZT values greater than 4 and 6 are predicted for 5-nm diameter PbSe/PbS and PbTe/PbSe superlattice NWs at 77 K. Alternatively, tubular nanostructures such as nanotubes (NTs), have also demonstrated a great potential as TE materials. For example Bi2T3 NTs have exhibit S about 160 μV/K at 300 K, which is higher than those observed in Bi2Te3 NWs.",

For example, most recently, Hou et al. prepared p-type Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 and epoxy resin composite thick film by hot-pressing (623 K, 4 MPa) and the film shows a high power factor (PF = α2σ) of 840 μW m-1 K-2. Recently, flexible substrate, such as polyimide, fiber or paper, has been used to support inorganic materials for preparing high performance and flexible TE materials. For instance, Gao et al. reported a glass-fiber-aided cold-pressing method for flexible n-type Ag2Te films on copy paper and the power factor value was up to 85 μW m-1 K-2 at 300 K. Choi et al. prepared n-type HgSe nanocrystal thin film by spin-coating HgSe nanocrystal solution on a plastic substrate and the film showing a maximum power factor of 550 μW m-1 K-2 at 300 K. Jin et al. deposited Bi2Te3 thick film on a cellulose fibers paper via an unbalanced magnetron sputtering technique and the composite film exhibits good flexibility and a power factor of ~250 μW m-1 K-2 at room temperature.",

Several groups have reported the TE performance of Ag2Se. For instance, Ferhat et al. prepared β-Ag2Se bulks by a direct-reaction of the element Ag and Se in evacuated quartz tubes at 1273 K and the maximum power factor of the material was about 3500 μW m-1 K-2, which is similar to that of the state-of-art material at room temperature. Most recently, Perez-Taborda et al. deposited Ag2Se films on glass substrates via pulsed hybrid reactive magnetron sputtering and the films showing a high power factor ~2440 μWm-1 K-2 at room temperature. Nevertheless, the films are with relatively high cost since an expensive facility is used.",

Here, L is defined as the Lorenz number equal to 2.44 × 10^-8 WΩ K-2. This formula has recently been redefined to solve the inconsistence between theoretical predication and experimental measurement. Before the 1990s, the progress of improving ZT had been slow and the best TE material was Bi2Te3 alloys with ZT ≈ 1.0 at 300 K. To increase ZT, many new approaches have been proposed, such as fabricating low-dimensional thermoelectric structures to increase large density of state, engineering the interface of materials to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity, and modulating dopants to increase carrier mobility. Subsequently, further improvements include ZT = 2.4 at 300 K for p-type Bi2Te3/Sb2Te3 superlattice, and ZT = 3 at 550 K for Bi-doped n-type PbSeTe/PbTe quantum-dot superlattice. A prospective of nanostructured TE materials can be found in a review paper. For practical applications, other issue such as size, maintenance and fast response time must also be considered even if high-efficiency TE materials are found ref..",

                    "context": "The world’s energy demands require more efficient methods of producing, storing, transmitting and using clean energy, such as electricity. Superconductors can help address all of these areas with more efficient generators/wind turbine generators, magnetic energy storage devices, power transmission lines, electric motors and so on. One key for these applications is to develop materials such as superconductor, photoelectric and thermoelectric materials that enable alternative energy ‘ecosystems’. For all of these material types, it is necessary to find industrially compatible ways to fabricate high-performance material. The method of nanocomposite inclusion in different perovskite materials is highly effective. Superconductive/thermoelectric material performance can be improved by adding nanoparticles (NPs) that disrupt the order parameter/phonon density while leaving the matrix and electronic structure of the superconductor/thermoelectric intact., In the case of thermoelectrics, the reduction of lattice thermal conductivity through phonon scattering by size-controlled NPs has been predicted in the seminal paper by Hicks and Dresselhaus. This approach has already been demonstrated to be effective in metallic materials, such as Bi2Te3/Sb2Te3 multilayers and PbTe bulk material with natural NP additions with a significant enhancement of the figure of merit (ZT) that has reached up to ~2 at 800 K. In comparison with metallic materials, oxides offer the advantages of reduced cost, nontoxicity and higher stability at high temperatures. Impressive performance using a nanoengineering approach has been obtained in SrTiO3 multilayers with added Nb nanoparticles. Thin films oxides, such as hexagonal Al-ZnO, perovskite RE2-xCexCuO4 (RE214) and RE-doped Sr3Ti2O7, have already demonstrated excellent thermoelectric properties even without the addition of NPs. Other materials, such as transparent delafossite CuAlO2, have the potential to be used as thermoelectrics. The paradigm of insertion and control of artificial NPs in high-Tc superconductors can be easily transferred to all of these other oxides to prepare efficient, environmentally friendly thermoelectric harvesters. It is also crucial to achieve this in a scalable, high-throughput (that is, economical) way. Metal organic deposition (MOD) fulfills all of these requirements; thus, finding ways to tailor the size and density of NPs while ensuring that the underlying matrix remains as pristine as possible is a goal that has been pursued for decades.",

In this work, n-type 800 nm Bi2Te3/(Pt, Au) multilayers are designed with p-type Sb2Te3 legs to fabricate ultrathin microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) TE devices. The power factor of the annealed Bi2Te3/Pt multilayer reaches 46.5 μW cm-1 K-2 at 303 K, which corresponds to more than a 350% enhancement when compared to pristine Bi2Te3. The annealed Bi2Te3/Au multilayers have a lower power factor than pristine Bi2Te3. The power of the device with Sb2Te3 and Bi2Te3/Pt multilayers measures 20.9 nW at 463 K and the calculated maximum output power reaches 10.5 nW, which is 39.5% higher than the device based on Sb2Te3 and Bi2Te3, and 96.7% higher than the Sb2Te3 and Bi2Te3/Au multilayers one. This work can provide an opportunity to improve TE properties by using multilayer structures and novel ultrathin MEMS TE devices in a wide variety of applications.",

This result has been possible thanks to the remarkable crystalline quality (bulk mosaicity of 0.01°, see Methods and Supplementary Note) achieved, allowing for unprecedented high-resolution measurements of the acoustic phonon lifetime by means of INS and NRSE. These measurements are supported by ab initio density functional theory (DFT) simulations, and allow us to experimentally confirmed of the long-established thermal transport modeling in complex systems.",

                    "context": "Optimization of the thermoelectric performance of TaFeSb-based half-Heuslers was realized by tuning the carrier concentration via Ti-doping. In our work, Ta1-xTixFeSb (x = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.10, 0.12, 0.14, 0.16, and 0.18) samples were prepared by the ball-milling and hot-pressing method. All of the samples are highly dense with an average grain size of ~250 nm (as shown in Supplementary Fig.) and they are single-phase with high crystallinity (as shown in Supplementary Fig.). For simplicity, the thermoelectric properties of only some of the Ta1-xTixFeSb specimens are shown in Fig. 3, while the complete results can be found in Supplementary Fig.. As shown in Fig. 3a, the electrical conductivity of the pristine TaFeSb is very low but it increases markedly with Ti-doping. Enhancement of the electrical conductivity should be attributed to the substantially increased hole concentration, as shown in Supplementary Fig.. It is ~5.26 × 10^20 cm-3 for Ta0.98Ti0.02FeSb and ~2.03 × 10^21 cm-3 for Ta0.84Ti0.16FeSb. This indicates that Ti is a very efficient dopant for supplying a high concentration of holes to TaFeSb, which is similar to the case of Ti-doping in NbFeSb. Due to the increased hole concentration, the Seebeck coefficient of Ta1-xTixFeSb (with the exception of TaFeSb) is reduced gradually with increasing Ti concentration, as shown in Fig. 3b. It should be noted that the undoped TaFeSb is fully p-type over the whole temperature range and its Seebeck coefficient increases with temperature without showing any bipolar conduction despite its low hole concentration. This should be ascribed to the relatively large band gap of ~0.53 eV for TaFeSb, which is even larger than that of NbFeSb (~0.41 eV), as shown in Supplementary Fig.. Optimization of the holeconcentration substantially improves the power factor of TaFeSb-based half-Heuslers, as shown in Fig. 3c. The room-temperature power factor is ~45 μW cm-1 K-2 for Ta0.84Ti0.16FeSb and its peak power factor can be as large as ~56 μW cm-1K-2, thus leading to its high average power factor of ~52 μW cm-1K-2 in the temperature range between 300 and 973 K. Such a high power factor outperforms most of the other state-of-the-art half-Heusler compounds, e.g., (Ti/Zr/Hf)CoSb, (Ti/Zr/Hf)NiSn, ZrNiPb, and NbCoSn. The origin of the high electronic thermoelectric performance of TaFeSb-based half-Heuslers can be partially ascribed to the unique electronic band structure, as shown in Fig. 3d. The valence band maximum locates at the L-point (with a carrier pocket degeneracy of four), where",

We report the development of a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT)-based high conversion efficiency, air-stable and flexible thermoelectric material. We prepared cobaltocene-encapsulated SWNTs (denoted CoCp2@SWNTs) and revealed that the material showed a negative-type (n-type) semiconducting behaviour (Seebeck coefficient: -41.8 μV K-1 at 320 K). The CoCp2@SWNT film was found to show a high electrical conductivity (43,200 S m-1 at 320 K) and large power factor (75.4 μW m-1 K-2) and the performance was remarkably stable under atmospheric conditions over a wide range of temperatures. The thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) value of the CoCp2@SWNT film (0.157 at 320 K) was highest among the reported n-type organic thermoelectric materials due to the large power factor and low thermal conductivity (0.15 W m-1 K-1). These characteristics of the n-type CoCp2@SWNTs allowed us to fabricate a p-n type thermoelectric device by combination with an empty SWNT-based p-type film. The fabricated device exhibited a highly efficient power generation close to the calculated values even without any air-protective coating due to the high stability of the SWNT-based materials under atmospheric conditions.",

In this study, two types of freestanding films of the CoCp2@SWNTs (Fig. 3a) and the empty-SWNTs were fabricated. The SEM image of a CoCp2@SWNT film (Fig. 3b) shows entanglement of the fibrous SWNTs and the length and diameter of the CoCp2 5 μm and 10–200 nm, respectively. The free-standing CoCp2@SWNT film enabled to bent to a 3.5 mm-radius over 1,000 times-bending test without any change in the surface resistance (Fig. 3c), indicating high flexibility due to the entangled network structures as shown in Fig. 3b. These films were used to measure the electrical conductivities and Seebeck coefficients at different temperatures and the results are shown in Fig. 3d and 3e, respectively. Of interest, the electrical conductivity of the CoCp2@SWNT film increased by one order of magnitude (43,200 S m-1 at 320 K) compared to that (4,450 S m-1) of the empty SWNTs. The electrical conductivity of the CoCp2@SWNTs film is higher than that of the SWNT film, which is explained by the increased carrier density, leading to an upshift of the Fermi level due to the charge transfer from the CoCp2 to the nanotubes. From the XPS result shown in Figure 2a, the CoCp2 was oxidized to CoCp2+, indicating the electron transfer from CoCp2 to the tubes and resulting in an increase in the carrier density of the nanotubes. Smalley et al. also reported the increase of conductivity of the nanotubes by chemical doping using potassium and Br2, resulting in increase of electrical conductivity due to an increase in carrier density. Furthermore, these values were almost constant in the temperature range of 310– 420 K. In order to explain the possible conduction mechanism of the CoCp2@SWNT film, we analyzed the temperature dependent electrical conductivities based on the variable range hopping (VRH) models using the following equation (1), . where σ(Τ) and T are the electrical conductivity (S m-1) and absolute temperature (K), respectively and T0 is a characteristic temperature used in the VRH model. d has a value of 1–3 (d = 1: Efros-Shklovskii (ES)-VRH, d = 2 or 3: Mott-VRH). Although the temperature-dependent electrical conductivities of the SWNT film were fitted well with the model similar with the previous study, for the CoCp2@SWNT film, the temperature dependent electrical",

The conversion from the p-type semiconductor to the n-type semiconductor by encapsulation of CoCp2 inside the nanotubes is derived from the change in charge carrier from holes to electrons due to the charge transfer from CoCp2 to the nanotube, as indicated from the XPS data shown in Figure 2a. Kawai et al. reported the relationship between the highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of dopants and the sign (i.e. positive/negative) of the Seebeck coefficient of the doped SWNT films. They reported that the dopants with HOMO above roughly 5.6 eV vs. vacuum altered the charge carrier of the carbon nanotubes from holes to electrons. The ionization energy of CoCp2 (solid state) was reported to be ~4.0 eV vs. vacuum. This indicates that it has sufficient electronic potential to reduce the SWNTs, which have an estimated reduction potential of the used SWNTs is ~4.2 V vs. vacuum. This indicates that charge transfer from CoCp2 to the nanotubes can occur, leading to the n-type semiconducting nature. Furthermore, based on the DFT calculations for the encapsulation of CoCp2 inside the SWNTs, Green et al. reported that the singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) of CoCp2 is higher than the conduction band of the (n,0)SWNT (n = 13–18). Thus, the charge transfer can proceed from CoCp2 to the SWNTs and the CoCp2@SWNTs shows n-type semiconducting behaviour. These values allowed us to calculate the power factor (W m-1 K-2) using the following equation (2), . where S and σ are the Seebeck coefficient (V K-1) and electric conductivity (S m-1), respectively. The power factor of the CoCp2@SWNT film (75.4 μW m-1 K-2 at 320 K) is much larger than that of the SWNT film due to its higher electrical conductivity than that of the empty SWNT film (Fig. 3f) and the value was larger than any other reported n-type SWNT-based materials as shown in Table 1. Generally, the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient show a trade-off nature,. However, in our CoCp2@SWNT film, the high electrical conductivity is compatible to a large Seebeck coefficient compared with the other n-type SWNT films (Table 1). We assumed that the doping",

Interestingly, both films were found to possess much lower κ values (0.12 and 0.15 W m-1 K-1 for the SWNT film and CoCp2@SWNT film, respectively) than the reported value of an individual SWNT (3500 W m-1 K-1). Instead, the obtained value was comparable to the reported random network SWNT films (0.1–0.2 W m-1 K-1). Such a low thermal conductivity would be derived from the huge interfacial thermal resistance (phonon-phonon Umklapp scattering) and their low density of the films (0.6–0.8 g cm-3, see Fig. 3b). Based on the result, we determined the ZT values using the following equation (4), . where S, σ and T are the Seebeck coefficient (V K-1), electric conductivity (S m-1) and absolute temperature (K), respectively. The ZT value of the CoCp2@SWNT film (0.157 at 320 K) was much higher than that of the SWNT film (0.025) due to its higher electrical conductivity than that of the SWNT film (Fig. 3e). Notably, the value was almost two times higher than that of the reported n-type CNT-based materials and the highest among the reported n-type organic thermoelectric materials (see Supplementary, Table S3).",

Due to their high electrical conductivity, the power factor of the material was much larger (75.4 μW m-1 K-2) than that of the films of empty-SWNTs (9.1 μW m-1 K-2) at 320 K. The ZT value of the CoCp2@SWNT film (0.157 at 320 K) was the highest among the reported n-type organic thermoelectric materials due to its high electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity (0.15 W m-1 K-1). The SWNT film doped with cobaltocene as an n-type dopant is a promising candidate for the next-generation thermoelectric materials due to the high electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity. We demonstrated that the developed flexible thermoelectric device that consisted of a CoCp2@SWNT film and empty SWNT film as the n- and p-doped semiconducting materials, respectively, generated voltages close to a calculated value with an excellent reversibility without any air-protective coating due to the characteristic air stability by the encapsulation. The device is quite attractive to collect a large amount of waste heat for electricity because the SWNT-based device is quite tough, flexible and has a high thermal stability.",

While the skutterudite phase was successfully synthesized, a small amount of the secondary phase (FeSb2) was observed. According to the scanning electron microscope analysis, (Ce,Pr)Sb2 phases were also observed for Co-substituted specimens (x = 0.5). The electrical conductivity decreased with increasing temperature, implying a degenerate semiconductor behavior, and also decreased with increasing Co contents. All specimens showed p-type characteristics having positive signs of the Hall coefficient and the Seebeck coefficient. The Seebeck coefficient increased with increasing temperature and reached a maximum value at 823 K. The power factor (PF) increased with decreasing Co content and Ce0.75Pr0.25\tFe4Sb12 showed a peak value of PF = 3.2 mW m-1 K-2 at 823 K. The electronic thermal conductivity decreased with increasing Co contents and the lattice thermal conductivity decreased with decreasing Ce and Co contents at high temperature. The thermal conductivity increased at temperatures above 623 K due to bipolar conduction. The dimensionless figure␣of merit (ZT) showed a maximum value of ZT = 0.84 at 823 K for Ce0.25Pr0.75Fe4Sb12.",

Owing to optimized carrier concentration and decreased κ by point defects, the nominal composition Cu1.95Pb0.015Se exhibits the highest ZT value of 1.52 at 973 K. The reduction of thermal conductivity by Pb doping is not ideal or enough, but the ZT value is higher than reports with doping elements Fe, In, Mn, and Sm under the same temperature, and is comparable to that doped with Hg or Ni in Cu2Se. While, the ZT value of 1.52 is lower than some reported record values, which are optimized and obtained by nano engineering or energy band engineering.",

The inset of Fig. 6 shows the zT value greatly enhanced by introducing Ga-CCCD with the same Yb filling fraction. The thermoelectric performance improvement is mainly attributed to its unique electronic band structure as well as mixed phonon scattering mechanism produced by Ga-CCCD. The thermoelectric performance of Ga-containing CCCD materials can be optimized by adjusting filling fraction of the secondary filler atoms, like Yb in this study.",

                    "context": "The thermal conductivity is measured at room temperature and values are presented in Table 2. Total thermal conductivity (κtotal) can be expressed as κtotal = κel + κph, where κel and κph represent the electronic and lattice thermal conductivity, respectively. κel can be calculated by using the Wiedemann–Franz–Lorenz relationship, κel = LσT, where L = π2k2/3e2 = 2.45 × 10^-8 W Ω K-2 is the Lorenz number and T is the absolute temperature. κph is obtained by subtracting κel from κtotal. It can be clearly seen from Table 2 that the total thermal conductivity for all the doped samples is less than that of CaMnO3-δ 1 Ω-cm, κel is negligible. But in our case, the resistivity is lower than 1 Ω-cm, a fact which leads us to determine the κel by using the Wiedemann-Franz law. The calculated value of κel, for CaMnO3-δ is 0.019 W m-1 K-1 and (Ca0.95Bi0.05MnO3-δ) is 0.11 W m-1 K-1 at 700 K, respectively. For all the samples, the lattice contribution is more important than the electronic one. Due to the small κel, κtotal is mainly attributed to the lattice contribution. The κtotal of Ca0.95Bi0.05MnO3-δ is about 1.91 W m-1 K-1 at 300 K. It should be emphasized that in contrast to the CaMnO3-δ the Ca0.95Bi0.05MnO3-δ samples show much lower κtotal. The κtotal of the doped sample (x = 0.05) is lower than the reported values of Bi doped CaMnO3 samples. Ohtaki et al. and Xu et al. have reported that κtotal: 3.0 W m-1 K-1 at 300 K for Ca0.9Bi0.1MnO3, 3.6 W m-1 K-1 at 300 K for Ca0.96Bi0.04MnO3, respectively. This suggests that partial substitution of Bi for Ca site and oxygen deficiency influence the total thermal conductivity. The figure of merit () is calculated for all the samples. The calculated values are presented in Table 2. The highest ZT (0.047) is reached for Ca0.95Bi0.05MnO3-δ, which represents a 487 % increase when compared with undoped sample (CaMnO3-δ). Ca0.95Bi0.05MnO3-δ exhibits a higher ZT value than the reported values by Xu et al. and by Ohtaki et al.. Xu et al. and Ohtaki et al. have reported that ZT value of ≈ 0.028 at 300 K for the Ca0.96Bi0.04MnO3, ZT value of 0.02 at 300 K for the Ca0.9Bi0.1MnO3, respectively. These results suggest that there is the scope for improvement of n-type materials for high temperature thermoelectric application.",

Figure 5c shows that our calculation considering electron–phonon coupling predicts a maximum PF of 11.7 mW m-1 K-2 for FeNbSb at 300 K, representing the upper limit without considering other scattering sources such as defects and grain boundaries. Our calculated S, σ, and PF of FeNbSb at optimized carrier concentration and temperatures from 200 to 500 K also compare well with a recent theoretical study that employs the same methodology. The good agreement between our calculations and experimental data confirms our assumption that electron–phonon coupling dominates carrier scattering in this system. It is noteworthy that the optimal PF of FeNbSb is significantly higher than that of PbTe at 300 K,.",

While X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the successful formation of the skutterudite phase, small amounts of secondary phases, including FeSb2 and Sb, were produced. However, when La and Ni contents were increased, no secondary phases were shown for the La0.9-1.0Fe3.5Ni0.5Sb12 specimen. This meant that the La filling fraction needed to be high to stabilize the skutterudite structure if the charge compensation with Ni was deficient. All samples had positive Hall coefficients and Seebeck coefficients, and the carrier concentration ranged from 8.72 × 10^20 cm-3 to 2.39 × 10^21 cm-3. The electrical conductivity and the thermal conductivity decreased and the Seebeck coefficient increased with increasing La and Ni contents due to the decreased carrier concentration. La0.9Fe3.5Ni0.5Sb12 achieved a maximum dimensionless figure of merit, ZT of 0.82 at 723 K on the basis of the high power factor (2.8 mWm-1K-2) and the low thermal conductivity (2.4 Wm-1K-1).",

The electrical conductivity of PSVA-treated PEDOT:PSS films was significantly enhanced, and the maximum value was up to 496 S cm-1 (treated with EG). Especially, utilizing the PSVA method, H2O could also remarkably enhance the electrical conductivity of pristine PEDOT:PSS film from 0.2 to 57 S cm-1. However, there was no distinct change for the Seebeck coefficient of PSVA-treated films with the significantly enhanced electrical conductivity. The PSVA-treated PEDOT:PSS films exhibited improved thermoelectric performance and the maximum a power factor was up to 9.47 μW m-1 K-2 (treated with DMSO) at room temperature. The improved thermoelectric performance might be attributed to the PSS loss from the PEDOT:PSS films and the conformational change of the PEDOT chains. These changes resulted into the simultaneous increase of carrier mobility and carrier concentration. All these results demonstrated that PSVA method might be an effective method to improve the thermoelectric performance of PEDOT:PSS films.",

However, studies on the thermoelectric properties of these orthorhombic compounds except for SnSe are few, and there is not a comparison of thermoelectric performance among them. Recently, Tan et al. experimentally found a modest ZT of 0.6 at 873 K in polycrystalline SnS, which is comparable to those measured in polycrystalline SnSe. Here, in order to search for more high-performance thermoelectric materials, we investigate and compare the thermoelectric properties of the orthorhombic IV–VI compounds by using the density function theory combined with the Boltzmann transport equation. We reveal that GeS, GeSe and SnS show similar thermoelectric properties to that of SnSe: large Seebeck coefficient, high power factor and low thermal conductivity. Importantly, the Seebeck coefficients of GeS,GeSe and SnS are even larger than that of SnSe under the studied carrier concentration and temperature region. Moreover, the Seebeck coefficients and power factors can be greatly enhanced by both n-type and p-type doping.",

The room temperature electrical conductivity is only ~ 0.08 × 10^4 S m-1 for undoped Mg3Sb2, lower than that reported by Song et al., but higher than that reported by Bhardwaj et al.. This difference might be related to the different concentration of Mg vacancy induced by the different synthesis conditions. Li doping increased the electrical conductivity because of the increased carrier concentration (see Fig. 3a). With increasing content of Li, the electrical conductivity first increased, and then decreased at x 0.006, indicating the lower doping limit (~ 0.6 atm.%) of Li in [Mg2Sb2]2- electronic framework, consistent with the room temperature carrier concentration dependence of x shown in Fig. 3a. The highest room temperature Hall carrier concentration is ~ 3 × 10^19 cm-3 for Mg2.994Li0.006Sb2, higher than the optimized Ag-doped Mg3Sb2 (~ 1 × 10^19 cm-3), but lower than the optimized Na-doped Mg3Sb2 (~ 8 × 10^19 cm-3). The existence of impurity Sb led to the abnormally increased carrier concentration and electrical conductivity in Mg2.965Li0.035Sb2. With increasing temperature, the electrical conductivity presented a metallic behavior in Mg2.994Li0.006Sb2, and changed to a semiconducting behavior in Mg2.975Li0.025Sb2 due to the decreased carrier concentration. The Seebeck coefficient of the undoped Mg3Sb2 is positive in the whole measured temperature range (Fig. 2b), consistent with the Hall measurement. Li doping decreased the Seebeck coefficient from ~ 336 to ~ 142 μV K-1. However, with the increased electrical conductivity, the maximum power factor (PF = σS2) increased dramatically from ~ 2 μW cm-1 K-2 at about 773 K for undoped Mg3Sb2 to ~ 6 μW cm-1 K-2 at about 773 K for Mg2.975Li0.025Sb2 (Fig. 2c), higher than those of Ag-doped Mg3Sb2 (~ 5 μW cm-1 K-2) and Pb-doped Mg3Sb2 (~ 3 μW cm-1 K-2).",

Experience has shown that engineering of the electronic density of states (eDOS) and the energy filtering mechanism (EFM) are two different effective approaches to improve the PF. However, the successful combination of these two methods is elusive. Here we show that the PF of β-Zn4Sb3 can greatly benefit from both effects. Simultaneous resonant distortion in eDOS via Pb-doping and energy filtering via introduction of interface potentials result in a ~40% increase of PF and an approximately twofold reduction of the lattice thermal conductivity due to interface scattering. Accordingly, the ZT of β-Pb0.02Zn3.98Sb3 with 3 vol.% of Cu3SbSe4 nanoinclusions reaches a value of 1.4 at 648 K. The combination of eDOS engineering and EFM would potentially facilitate the development of high-performance thermoelectric materials.",

However, compared to inorganic counterparts, the relatively poor thermoelectric performance of PEDOT:PSS has greatly limited its development and high-tech applications. Here, we report a dramatic enhancement in the thermoelectric performance of PEDOT:PSS by constructing unique composite films with graphene quantum dots (GQDs). At room temperature, the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of PEDOT:PSS/GQDs reached to 7172 S/m and 14.6 μV/K, respectively, which are 30.99% and 113.2% higher than those of pristine PEDOT:PSS. As a result, the power factor of the optimized PEDOT:PSS/GQDs composite is 550% higher than that of pristine PEDOT:PSS. These significant improvements are attributed to the ordered alignment of PEDOT chains on the surface of GQDs, originated from the strong interfacial interaction between PEDOT:PSS and GQDs and the separation of PEDOT and PSS phases. This study evidently provides a promising route for PEDOT:PSS applied in high-efficiency thermoelectric conversion.",

The alloys showed a figure of merit ZT near 0.6 at ~125 K in zero magnetic field and up to 0.7 in a moderate in-situ magnetic field produced with a compact combined NdFeB/BiSb/NdFeB system. The obtained ZT values significantly exceeded those of polycrystalline averaged BiSb single crystal value of ~0.4 as well as Bi2Te3 alloys with ZT~0.3 most often used for TE cooling applications. A low thermal conductivity was obtained by fabrication via rapid solidification, which created a fine-grained structure. A two-band effective mass model was employed to simulate the thermoelectric transport properties, which uncovered a heretofore unreported narrowing of the indirect band gap with increased temperature. The versatility of the compact TE-magnetic system makes it possible to couple n-type BiSb with a p-type cryogenic thermoelectric material in a cooling device.",

Na0.05Cu1.95S and Na0.15Cu1.85S samples demonstrate a low conductivity of about 60 S cm-1 at ambient temperature. The temperature dependences of the electronic conductivity of the investigated Na0.05Cu1.95S, Na0.1Cu1.9S, Na0.15Cu1.85S, and Na0.2Cu1.8S compounds in the range from 20 to 450 °C demonstrate several extrema. The anomalies near 90 and 100 °C obviously are caused by the phase transitions in chalcocite and djurleite phases. The deep minima of the conductivity near 350–400 °C perhaps reflects the phase transition to the superionic cubic phase. In stoichiometric Cu2S, the phase transition occurs at 435 °C, but in the NaхCu2 - хS compounds the copper deficit shifts the phase transition point to lower temperatures obviously.",

The combination of two-dimensional (2D) dichalcogenides with other 2D or low dimensional materials, such as graphene boron nitride or other dichalcogenides have interesting applications. In principle it provides a completely new class of artificial materials with designed electronic, optical and mechanical properties. Tuning of electronic properties of 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials are important for their application in optoelectronics. Monolayer TMDs with formula MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) describes the class of semiconductors with narrow direct band gap, large exciton binding energies, high photoelectrochemical activity and high optoconductivity. Such materials, due to inversion symmetry breaking are used for the study of valley polarization and spin-vally coupling. Heterostructures (HSs) are used on a large scale in conventional semiconductors for achieving tunable electronic properties. For the development of future 2D materials, the HSs with Van der Waals interactions have been recognized as promising candidates and TMD-based hybrid multilayered structures are a prototype van der Waals HSs. It has been reported that the protected phosphorene and tunable carrier dynamics and optical properties can be achieved by coupling of phosphorene with stable graphene or hBN and even phosphorene suboxide and organism TiL4. According to a theoretical study, phosphorene/graphene HS has been proposed as an anode material for rechargeable Li batteries. The phosphorene/MoS2 HS is a suitable type-II semiconductor for ultraviolet photodetector applications. Moreover, the black-phosphorus/blue-phosphorus HS is predicted to be used in solar energy conversion. Rapid transfer of photogenerated charge carriers between MoSe2 and graphene has been found in MoSe2/graphene HSs depicting its applications in optoelectronics; black phosphorene/MoSe2 HS show potential applications in p-n diodes and logical devices. Insulating perovskite substrate SrTiO3 has also been coupled with MoS2 monolayer that shows direct semiconducting band gap and chemisorption of MoS2 monolayer has been observed. Cathodoluminescence and photon emission excited by a high-energy electron beam can be applied in the analysis of mineral compositions, light emitting diodes and surface plasmon mapping. Compared to photoluminescence the cathodoluminescence offers a much higher excitation energy allowing the study of wide band gap materials including diamond and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The",

It leads to a large increase in the carrier mobility (Hall mobility in the range of 10 cm2/Vs), increase in the effective mass up to m* = 8 and to additional increase in the carrier concentration. After reduction, niobium-doped strontium titanate can reach an electrical conductivity of 15,000 S/m at 1,000 K and preserve a Seebeck coefficient of -250 μV/K, so that, at similar thermal conductivity, the figure of merit is dramatically increased to ZT = 0.25 (1,000 K). At the same level of reduction, donor dopants play an important role in reduced material and drive the electrical conductivity to higher values, while the Seebeck coefficient is hardly altered, so that the figure of merit is continuously improved with increasing donor dopant level.",

Those assumptions were proven wrong by later work. In, various reduced rutile and Magnéli phases were processed and their electrical and thermal properties measured; ZT(1,000 K) was not found to exceed 0.2.",

Seebeck coefficients of -100 to -200 μV/K (widely independent of stoichiometry) at electrical conductivity of 100–20,000 S/m were reported for NbO2; the best power factors (2 × 10^-4 W/mK2 0.1. The same authors reported Seebeck coefficients ranging from -100 to -500 μV/K (1,000 K) for Nb2O5 with highest values close to the 2:5 stoichiometry. A similar set of data projected slightly lower electrical conductivities. Most of the reported materials were made from coarse powders by natural sintering; even though information on grain size and density is lacking, the large differences in electrical conductivities suggest that the grain boundaries in those materials acted as strong barriers for transport (impurity segregation, intergranular glass, space charge layers or…).",

NbO was an excellent conductor with more than 200,000 S/m, a Seebeck coefficient of 25 μV/K and high lattice conductivity of 8 W/mK (1,000 K). NbO2 ceramics showed lower electrical conductivity, 15,000 S/m, Seebeck coefficient of 150 μV/K and lattice conductivity of 3 W/mK (1,000 K). Pure Nb2O5 materials exhibited the low electrical conductivity of an insulator (2,600 S/m at 1,000 K) with Seebeck coefficient (220 μV/K), so that reduction was needed to achieve good thermoelectric performance. The beneficial effect of CS defects in Nb2O5 was immediately apparent in its low lattice conductivity, which was without further optimization in the order of 2 W/mK.",

Figure 14 shows typical microstructures of the materials. The thermoelectric performance of the sub-stoichiometric phases and their mixtures are shown in Fig. 15. Compositions with Nb2O5-type structures clustered in one group with low electrical conductivity (<5,000 S/m at 1,000 K) with negative temperature dependency and a moderate Seebeck coefficient (-150 to -300 μV/K at 1,000 K) that improved with temperature. Compositions in the range from Nb12O29 to NbO2+x formed a second group of materials with semiconductor-type electrical conductivity and reached about 30,000 S/m at 1,000 K with smaller Seebeck coefficients around -100 μV/K at 1,000 K. Both material groups showed the same low lattice thermal conductivity of about 2 W/mK2 at high temperature, but differed at low temperature. The Nb12O29 group adopted higher lattice conductivity, while Nb2O5-type materials demonstrated temperature-independent lattice conductivity. The figure of merit of the Nb12O29-based materials was higher and reached ZT(1,000 K) = 0.16, Fig. 15.",

Because of its higher thermal conductivity value (κ = 10 W/m K), it has not been used in practical applications. The energy of covalent bonds analysis illustrates that the energy states closer to the Fermi level are from Cr d-states with some contribution from the Cr–Si hybridized levels. It indicates that both substitutions at Cr and Si sites can change the transport properties in CrSi2. Nishida et al. studied the substitution of Cr atom sites by Mn atom. They found that Mn atoms act as a donor and Cr1-xMnxSi2 solid solution changes from p- to n-type with increasing x. According to Pan et al., Al atoms on Cr sites act as an acceptor; thus, no conversion from p- into n-type semiconductor took place in Cr(Si1-xAlx)2 with increasing x. In connection with these facts, the purpose of the present report is to investigate the effect of co-substitution of Mn atoms on Cr sites and Al atoms on Si sites on the transport properties and ZT of Cr1-xMnxSi2-xAlx solid solution.",

Figure 7 shows the ZT values as a function of composition and temperature up to 773 K. The Cr1-xMnxSi2-xAlx alloys exhibit higher ZT values than pure CrSi2 over the entire temperature range, and ZT increases with Mn and Al contents. At 300 K, ZT = 0.020 and 0.025 for CrSi2 and Cr0.90Mn0.10Si1.90Al0.10, respectively. The maximum value of ZT = 0.095 was observed at 625 K for x = 0 and ZT = 0.13 at 625 K for x = 0.10. The TE efficiency of CrSi2 is significantly increased with both Mn and Al substitution.",

The highest ZT of 0.025 is obtained at 723 K along the // direction for SnSe:Bi 6% sample, which seems to be the optimal doping content. Due to the small electrical conductivity, the total thermal conductivity is mostly attributed to the lattice thermal conductivity. Therefore, lower thermal conductivity is obtained along the // direction owing to the weak atomic connections. Consequently, higher ZT values are obtained along the // direction. However, these ZT values are quite small compared to those of single crystal or even other polycrystalline SnSe due to the lower S and σ values.",

The samples exhibited the layered structure with a preferential (h00) orientation. An anisotropic transport and thermoelectric properties have been observed. The electrical conductivities perpendicular to the pressing direction (12.85 S cm-1) are higher than those parallel to the pressing direction (6.46 S cm-1) at 773 K for SnSe:Bi 8% sample, while thermal conductivities perpendicular to the pressing direction (0.81 W m- 1 K-1) are higher than those parallel to the pressing direction (0.60 W m-1 K-1) at 773 K for SnSe:Bi 8% sample. We observed a bipolar conducting mechanism in our samples leading to n- to p-type transition, whose temperature increases with Bi concentration. The optimum Bi doping concentration was 6% with the highest ZT value of 0.025 at 723 K. This ZT value is quite low due to the low electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient. Our work addressed a possibility to dope polycrystalline SnSe by a hot-pressing process, which may be applied to module applications.",

Figure S2(a) shows the electronic conductivities of Cu2Te, Cu1.99Ga0.01Te, Cu1.97Ga0.03Te and Cu1.95Ga0.05Te. It was observed that the electronic conductivities increased significantly with the increase in doping content of Ga (Fig. 3c). There were a lot of intrinsic vacancies in Cu2-xTe, which were substituted by the Ga3+ n-type donor contributed three electrons to the system leading to the initiation of the large number of free electrons, particularly near the conduction band maxima (CBM). The peak electronic conductivity of 2.75 × 10^6 S/m was achieved in case of Cu1.95Ga0.05Te in the vicinity of VBM, the magnitudes of σ decreased in the CB compared to the valence band and exhibited the highest depletion near the Fermi level due to the absence of charge carriers. The highest enhancement factor in electronic conductivity was around 7 for Cu1.95Ga0.05Te, as shown in Fig. 3c. The same trend of variation of electronic conductivity was also observed in the case of, Cu1.99Ga0.01Te, and Cu1.97Ga0.03Te with conductivities increasing with the Ga content. The Seebeck coefficients, however, did not exhibit an increasing trend with increasing electron concentration as a result of doping (Fig. S2b). The composition Cu1.99Ga0.01Te showed the maximum Seebeck coefficient value of S = 365 μV/K in the energy range -9 to -8 eV (please refer to Fig. S2b), much higher than the peak S value of pristine Cu2Te at 745 K (50 μV/K). Maximum values of positive Seebeck coefficients were obtained in the same energy -9 to -8 eV for all the other compositions, with Cu1.95Ga0.05Te exhibiting the second highest Speak value of 310 μV/K, followed by Cu2Te (Speak = 255 μV/K) and Cu1.97Ga0.03Te (Speak = 240 μV/K). Compared to pristine Cu2Te, the highest enhancement factor of ~58 in Seebeck coefficient was observed in Cu1.99Ga0.01Te followed by 40 times enhancement in Cu1.97Ga0.03Te (Fig. 3b).Thus the enhancement in Seebeck coefficients did not occur as a function of increasing Ga concentration unlike the electronic conductivity, such behavior may be attributed due to the trade-off between S and σ to maximize the power factor.",

For pristine Cu2Te, the Seebeck coefficient reached a peak value of ~45 μV/K, quite close to those reported for the directly annealed Cu2Te pellets at 600 K. With the incorporation of Ga doping, considerable enhancement of the thermopower was further achieved with the peak S value obtained in the case of Cu1.97Ga0.03Te (Speak = 70 μV/K). The peak thermopower values in Cu1.97Ga0.03Te and Cu1.95Ga0.05Te were about 2 and 1.5 times (Fig. 7b) respectively that of pristine Cu2Te at 600 K, which significantly promoted the thermoelectric performance. Power factor measurements, which is a yardstick for determining heat losses in TE, were also performed for the compositions as shown in Fig. 6(e). All the compositions except Cu1.95Ga0.05Te exhibited an increasing trend of power factor with temperature. This was due to the fact, that in Cu1.97Ga0.03Te, S exhibited a decreasing trend in the temperature range 450–550 K due to the opposing effect of minority and majority charge carriers quite common in narrow band semiconductors. At room temperatures, incorporation of Ga doping of 5% enhanced the power factor to 1.5 μW/K2cm, which was a 25% enhancement from that obtained in the spark-plasma sintered Cu2Te pellets at 300 K. Maximum PF of 2.3 μW/K2cm at 600 K was achieved in case of Cu1.97Ga0.03Te. In essence, the thermopower and the power factors was comparable to the state of the art TE materials like skutterudite CoSb3 and CuCrSe2. With respect to pristine Cu2Te, the highest enhancements (3–3.5) in PF were achieved between 300–400 K for Cu1.97Ga0.03Te, but at higher temperatures of 400–600 K, the composition Cu1.95Ga0.05Te showed the highest PF enhancements of 2–1.5 (Fig. 7c). On the other hand, 1% doping of Ga resulted in a decrease in the PF particularly in the temperature zone of 300–400 K.",

At 1000 K for both La3Cu3P4 and La3Cu3As4 thermopowers in the range of 180–300 μV/K are found for hole concentrations between 6 × 10^19 cm-3 to 2 × 10^20 cm-3. Due to the substantial bandgap of La3Cu3P4 and La3Cu3As4, there are no bipolar effects and therefore thermopower keeps on increasing with temperature even at low doping concentrations. Due to the higher effective masses (presented in Table 1) the thermopower for p-type doping is nearly 1.5 times higher than that of n-type doping. Thermopower under n-type doping is presented in the Supplementary Information Fig. S4. Next we discuss thermopower for La3Cu3Sb4 and La3Cu3Bi4. With a calculated bandgap of 0.24 and 0.33 eV for Bi and Sb compound we expect significant bipolar conduction at high temperatures. The experimental measurements for hole doped thermopower of La3Cu3Sb4 were carried out by Fess et al. Their measured 300 K thermopower of ~60 μV/K at hole doping of 5.1 × 10^20 cm-3 agrees well with our calculated value of 55 μV/K. As shown in Fig. 4(b) we find that 1000 K hole doped thermopower barely exceeds 200 μV/K. The n-type thermopower does not even exceed -180 μV/K (shown in Supplementry Information Fig. S4.), indicating poor thermoelectric performance under n-type doping.",

                    "context": "We turn our attention to semi-metallic HgTe whose properties are in the transition region between semiconductors and metals. HgTe has a very high electron/hole effective mass ratio me/mh≃0.1 which results in large values of the Seebeck coefficient between -90 μV/K and -135 μV/K at room temperatures which is similar to the Seebeck coefficient of heavily doped semiconductors with a band gap. The carrier concentration of intrinsic HgTe is only 10^16–10^17 cm-3 which is much smaller than a metal or a typical good heavily-doped semiconductor thermoelectric. However, the large electron mobility in HgTe (μ 10^4 cm2/V.s) makes up for its low carrier concentration and as a result, the electrical conductivity of an intrinsic sample is relatively large and is about σ = 1700 S/cm at room temperatures. The large electron mobility is partly due to the small effective mass of the electrons and partly because of the absence of dopants. The mobility of a heavily doped semiconductor is limited by ionized impurity scattering which is not the case in an intrinsic semi-metal. The experiment reveals that intrinsic HgTe is a high power factor material with PF = 14–31 μW cm-1 K-2 at T = 300 K that is comparable to well-known thermoelectric materials such as SnSe (PF≃10 μW cm-1 K-2), PbTe1-xSex (PF≃25 μW cm-1 K-2) and Bi2Te3 (PF≃50 μW cm-1 K-2) at their zT maximum. Apart from having a good electrical transport properties, mercury telluride is a good thermal insulator with κ = 2.1 W/mK at T = 300 K. The overall zT of intrinsic single crystal without any optimization is between 0.4 to 0.5 and is comparable with most good thermoelectric materials at room temperature.",

Usually, this calculation is assumed based on a single parabolic band with three-dimensional transport character. In this study, BiCuSeO polycrystalline samples were examined at a random grain orientation because it is difficult to extract the directional dependence of the physical properties for a polycrystalline sample. Therefore, all values provided in this paper are averaged estimates. The scattering factor (r) is -1/2 as the acoustic phonon scattering is independent of the grain size and is generally assumed to be the main scattering mechanism at room temperature. The reduced Fermi energy η was determined based on the fitting of respective Seebeck values (the details are provided in the SI). The calculation provides an effective mass (m*) of ~0.60 mo, which is consistent with 0.54 mo determined by density of state calculations and higher than that of PbTe (0.24 mo) and PbS (0.40 mo) with a rock salt structure. The combined electrical conductivity and positive temperature-dependent Seebeck coefficient result in a power factor (S2σ) peak at a high temperature of 923 K. As shown in Figure 5c, the highest power factor is ~4.74 μW cm-1 K-2 for the Bi0.925Ca0.075CuSeO sample at 923 K, which is higher than ~4.10 μW cm-1 K-2 at 923 K for the BiCu0.975SeO sample.",

The total thermal conductivity of undoped BiCuSeO decreases with increasing temperature from 0.89 W m-1 K-1 at 300 K to 0.45 W m-1 K-1 at 923 K (heat capacity (Supplementary Figure S2) and thermal diffusivity (Supplementary Figure S3)). This total thermal conductivity is very low and comparable to other high-performance thermoelectric materials,, even lower than that of nanostructured Bi–Sb–Te. The total thermal conductivity increases with increasing Ca content but still maintains low over the entire measuring temperature range, for example, 1.05 W m-1 K-1 at 300 K and 0.52 W m-1K-1 at 923 K for the Bi0.90Ca0.10CuSeO sample. Generally, the lattice thermal conductivity κlat can be estimated by directly subtracting the electronic thermal conductivity κele from the total thermal conductivity κtot. The electronic part κele is proportional to the electrical conductivity σ through the Wiedemann–Franz relation, κele=LσT, where L is the Lorenz number obtained from fitting the respective Seebeck coefficient values with an estimate of the reduced chemical potential (η), as shown in Supplementary Figure S4 (Lorenz number calculation details can be found in the SI; the electronic thermal conductivity κele is shown in Supplementary Figure S5). Figure 4e shows the lattice thermal conductivity as a function of temperature for Bi1-xCaxCuSeO samples. BiCuSeO shows a very low lattice thermal conductivity of 0.88 W m-1 K-1 at 300 K and 0.43 W m-1 K-1 at 923 K, which is much lower than those of PbTe-based thermoelectrics., The possible origin of the intrinsically low thermal conductivity of BiCuSeO will be discussed later in this paper. As the thermal conductivity values are very low, it is worth comparing them with the calculated minimum lattice thermal conductivity κlat,min for BiCuSeO to assess if there is still room for improvement. The lattice thermal conductivity κlat can be estimated by the following relationship,.",

                    "context": "Figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of Seebeck coefficient S, electrical conductivity σ, and power factor PF, respectively, for PBCSO samples with different annealing time. It is worth knowing that the electrical transport properties were all measured along the direction perpendicular to the pressing direction as shown in the inset of Fig. 3b. Compared with pristine BiCuSeO, both S and σ for the un-annealed sample PBCSO had been modulated, resulting in high PF of ~ 900 mWm-1 K-2 at 323 K. The significant enhancement in PF constituted the major reason for the increase of ZTs. In this work, we found that the transport properties of PBSCSO samples were greatly influenced by the annealing process. As shown in Fig. 3a, the values of S at 323 K decrease from ~ 150 μVK-1 for the un-annealed PBSCSO to ~ 125 μVK-1 for the PBCSO-A-5D. For all samples, the temperature-dependent behavior unchanged. With increasing temperature up to 873 K, however, the curves of S(T) increased, suggesting that the conductivity is still maintained after annealing. The decline in S is due to the increase in hole carrier concentration, which will be discussed later. The variation of electrical conductivity σ as shown in Fig. 3b is opposite to the S(T) as it increased after the annealing process. For all samples, the values of σ decreased with the increasing temperature, indicating a degenerated semiconductor behavior, which can also be normally observed in other Bi-site-doped BiCuSeO compounds. The σ for PBCSO was ~ 415 Scm-1 at 323 K, which increased to ~ 575 Scm-1 for PBCSO-A-1D and then decreased to ~ 500 Scm-1 for 3 days and 5 days annealed samples. As we all know, σ(T) usually exhibits the inverse relationship with S(T) mainly due to the coupling with carrier concentration. The enlarged carrier concentration ordinarily accelerates the decrease in S and brings the advantage to the σ, consisting with the results in Fig. 3a and b. Extending the annealing time up to 3 days and 5 days did not further optimize the transport properties, as the values of σ for PBCSO-A-3D and PBCSO-A-5D were all lower than that of PBCSO-A-1D sample. The existence of the second phase Bi2O3 as confirmed by XRD and EDX results may exhibit negative effects on the electrical conductivity. The temperature dependence of power factor (PF = S2σ) combining the variation in S and σ for all PBCSO samples is shown",

Our calculation results show that 50% Hf doping in ZrNiSn simultaneously increases the degeneracy (Nv) at the bottom of conduction band (CB) and the dispersion of energy-band near the CB edge, which are helpful to increasing S and slightly enhanceing σ. Meanwhile, we elucidate that why 2% Sb co-doping further largely improves σ. It increases total density of states near the Fermi energy (EF) and leads to the convergence of the light and heavy bands and valley degeneracy. Nv reaches eleven at the Γ point of the bottom of conduction band. Besides, our work also demonstrates that Hf0.5Zr0.5NiSn0.98Sb0.02still maintains high μ in spite of mb⁎ increasing. Therefore, a great improvement in σ occurs. The ZT (~1.37) of Hf0.5Zr0.5NiSn0.98Sb0.02 with the n of 7.56 × 10^18 cm-3 at 1000 K is predicted.",

However, the highest electrical conductivity is obtained for the In0.2Co4Sb12qu sample with 1200 S cm-1 at about 350 K and descends as a function of temperature, indicating a heavily doped semiconductor system. The sample In0.2Co4Sb12 shows similar temperature characteristics at a lower absolute value starting at 950 S cm-1 at about 350 K, whereas the sample with x = 0.05 displays a relatively low electrical conductivity and characteristics of beginning intrinsic semiconductor behavior at about 550 K, where the electrical conductivity of the sample increases again because of the bipolar conduction. This is compliant with the results on the thermal conductivity data.",

Anisotropic thermoelectric properties were clearly exhibited. Indeed, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity along b and c axes are much larger than those along a axis, while Seebeck coefficient along a axis is slightly larger. So we observed maximum PF along b and c axes are 11.98 and 10.36 μWcm-1 K-2, while that along a axis is 4.29 μWcm-1 K-2. Temperature-dependent ZT along a, b and c axes are shown in Fig. 6. Highest ZT value of 2.2 was observed along b axis at about 733 K, while those along c and a axes are 2.1 and 0.8, respectively. This result is comparable to ZT=2.6 at 923 K for the reported p-type SnSe, indicating that both n- and p-type SnSe exhibit excellent thermoelectric properties, as predicted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The anisotropic trend is similar with p-type SnSe. However, the optimum temperature is 773 K in Bi-doped SnSe, whereas 923 K in p-type SnSe.",

In Figure 3a, SbCrSe3 exhibits a low electrical conductivity at room temperature but increases with increasing temperature because of the thermal activation of the intrinsic carriers. In the Pb-doped SbCrSe3 compounds, Pb behaved like an effective p-type dopant and each Pb atom that substituted for Sb was expected to contribute one hole to the valence band of SbCrSe3. Consequently, Pb doping led to a markedly enhanced electrical conductivity. The electrical conductivity σ significantly increased from 0.054 S m-1 at 300 K in the pristine SbCrSe3 to 1586.1 S m-1 at 300 K for the Pb-doped sample at x=0.05. Figure 3b shows the Hall carrier concentration p and carrier mobility μ for the Pb-doped compounds at room temperature. Pristine SbCrSe3 has a low hole carrier concentration of p~2.2 × 10^16 cm-3. As expected, the concentration of holes dramatically increased upon doping with Pb and reached p~0.9 × 10^19 cm-3 and p~4.5 × 10^19 cm-3 for compounds with Pb contents of x=0.01, 0.03 and 0.05, respectively. Although the mobility of holes is low in the range of 1.5–2.3 cm2 V-1 s-1, an interesting rising trend with the content of Pb up to x=0.03 was demonstrated. This trend is likely due to the disruption of localized Cr 3d orbitals upon Pb doping on the Sb site. The mobility values are comparable to those measured on doped MnSb2Se4 but are lower than the mobilities of the state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials BiCuSeO and alpha-MgAgSb. In SbCrSe3, we ascribed low mobilities to the strong scattering of the charge carriers (holes), the natural low dimensionality of the crystal structure and the spatially localized nature of Cr 3d orbitals.",

The total thermal conductivity κ can be divided into contributions from the lattice κL and charge carrier κe, which are referred to as the electrical thermal conductivity. Assuming a constant Lorenz number L=2.45 × 10^-8 V2 K-2, κe can be estimated by the Wiedemann–Franz law (κe=LσT). Consequently, κL can be readily obtained by subtracting κe from κ. In both doped and undoped PbxSb1-xCrSe3, κe is small (<0.08 W m-1 K-1) (Figure 6b) because of the relatively low electrical conductivity. In Figure 6c, owing to Umklapp scattering, κL decreased with increasing temperature up to ~800 K, at which point the bipolar contribution was noticeable. The thermal diffusivity λ showed a negative temperature dependence below 800 K, whereas above this temperature intrinsic excitations dominated. The SbCrSe3 compound exhibited low lattice thermal conductivities of 1.08 W m-1 K-1 at 300 K and 0.56 W m-1 K-1 at 900 K, which are lower than those of the other PbTe-based materials.Figure 6d displays the ZT values of PbxSb1-xCrSe3. The peak ZT of undoped SbCrSe3 was 0.018 at 800 K. The doped samples exhibited much higher ZTs and the peak value was shifted towards higher temperatures. The largest ZT=0.46 was achieved at 900 K in Pb0.05Sb0.95CrSe3. This value is 24 times larger than the figure of merit of pristine SbCrSe3. Such increased ZT values in the doped compounds were attributed to cooperatively acting large enhancements in the electrical conductivity and the decreased lattice thermal conductivity upon Pb doping.",

                    "context": "Considering that the room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity of SbCrSe3 is 1.08 W m-1 K-1 and that of Pb0.05Sb0.95Cr5Se8 is 0.78 W m-1 K-1, Pb doping depressed κL by 28%. This reduction indicates that the Pb/Sb disorder in the Sb sublattice strongly enhanced the phonon scattering (details are in the Supporting Information). In Figure 7a, the experimental data followed the same trend that was predicted by the model, although the experimental data are to some degree higher than the calculated values. Γmass and Γstrain are plotted in Figure 7b. It is clear that the value of Γstrain is much larger than that of Γmass. This demonstrates that strain field fluctuations, which were introduced by substituting Pb in the Sb sublattice, are the dominant factor in the point-defect scattering of phonons and led to a significantly decreased lattice thermal conductivity in Pb-doped SbCrSe3 compounds. The large strain field fluctuation contribution is related to the local structural distortion between the double-ladder chains. Figure 7c shows the local coordination environment of the Sb and Pb atoms between the ferromagnetism chains of SbCrSe3 (left) and Pb0.0625Sb0.9375CrSe3 (right), which was based on the DFT optimization. In SbCrSe3, the Sb atom was coordinated with three Se atoms and formed almost equidistant bond lengths (2.689 Å, 2.689 Å and 2.714 Å) that produced a relatively stable triangular pyramid between the double-ladder chains. However, when an impurity Pb atom was introduced, the Pb atoms were more inclined to form bonds with the Se atoms on the neighboring chain, which resulted in the coordination number of the Pb atom of four (3.139 Å, 2.998 Å, 2.818 Å and 2.818 Å). Moreover, the originally relatively stable triangular pyramid became a relatively unstable square pyramid. Therefore, the location of the Pb atom in Pb0.0625Sb0.9375CrSe3 deviated from the original relatively stable location of the Sb atom in SbCrSe3, which led to additional local distortion. The large differences in the coupling forces of a Se atom with Pb and a Se atom with Sb are expected to produce to a strong strain fluctuation contribution in the phonon scattering. A similarly strong strain fluctuation contribution arising from the presence of impurity atoms was also observed in CuFeS2 and Cu2Zn1-xFexGeSe4.",

In order to proceed in this direction, it is essential to have thermoelectric materials that are environmentally friendly and exhibit high figure of merit, ZT. Oxide thermoelectric materials are considered ideal for such applications. High thermoelectric performance has been reported in single crystals of Ca3Co4O9. However, for large scale applications single crystals are not suitable and it is essential to develop high-performance polycrystalline thermoelectric materials. In polycrystalline form, Ca3Co4O9 is known to exhibit much weaker thermoelectric response than in single crystal form. Here, we report the observation of enhanced thermoelectric response in polycrystalline Ca3Co4O9 on doping Tb ions in the material. Polycrystalline Ca3-xTbxCo4O9 (x = 0.0–0.7) samples were prepared by a solid-state reaction technique. Samples were thoroughly characterized using several state of the art techniques including XRD, TEM, SEM and XPS. Temperature dependent Seebeck coefficient, electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity measurements were performed. A record ZT of 0.74 at 800 K was observed for Tb doped Ca3Co4O9 which is the highest value observed till date in any polycrystalline sample of this system.",

Du et al. reached a zT of 1.4 at 550 K after doping AgSbTe2 with 2% Se. Concentrations of silver lower than the stoichiometry can produce impurities in the matrix or form precipitates, both of which are favorable to reduce the thermal conductivity. In particular, Sb2Te3/Ag2Te composites fabricated using ball milling have been found to improve the zT up to 1.5 at 700 K, and AgSbTe2/Ag2Te quenched ingots reached 1.5 at 500 K. Besides the material composition and doping, the morphology is been shown to be a key parameter in the resulting thermoelectric properties. For instance, our previous studies demonstrated a zT of 0.35 for electrodeposited Sb37Te63 films pre-annealed at 80 °C due to the combination of low thermal conductivity and enhanced power factor provided by a secondary phase; and nanostructured Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 achieved a zT above 1 at room temperature by inducing small grain sizes and highly dense dislocations.",

Figure 6 shows the schematic diagram of hall measurement set up to study the electrical properties of SnS nanofilm. The variation of electrical conductivity with substrate temperature in the temperature range 300–345 K is depicted in Fig. 7a. From the Fig. 7a it is clear that with increase in substrate temperature the conductivity of the SnS nanofilms (14 °C SnS, 30 °C SnS and 70 °C SnS) increase which indicates the semiconducting behavior of the nanocrystals. Grain size take plays an important role for the variation of electrical conductivity with substrate temperature. Also smaller the crystal size higher is the resistivity. The room temperature (300 K) conductivity of the 14 °C SnS, 30 °C SnS and 70 °C SnS nanofilm were 0.020 Ohm-1 cm-1, 0.025 Ohm-1 cm-1 and 0.037 Ohm-1 cm-1, respectively. M. Calixto-Rodriguez et al. studied on tin sulfide thin film grown by spray pyrolysis and reported conductivity value was ~ 10^-4 Ohm-1 cm-1. N. Koteeswara Reddy et al. reported electrical conductivity of ~ 0.033 Ohm-1 cm-1 for tin sulfide films prepared by spray pyrolysis in the temperature range 100 °C–450 °C. The reported conductivity at room temperature was 0.193 Ohm-1 cm-1 and 0.063 Ohm-1 cm-1 for parallel and perpendicular layers plane of SnS single crystals, respectively, studied by Nassary. Hegde et al. reported electrical conductivity 0.008 Ohm-1 cm-1 of SnS semiconductor crystals grown by physical vapor deposition technique. The activation energy of the SnS nanofilms was calculated from the Arrhenius equation. where σ is the electrical conductivity of the SnS nanofilms, σ0 is the pre-exponential factor, k is the Boltzmann constant and Ea is the activation energy of the SnS nanofilms. A plot ln σ versus 1/T is shown in Fig. 7b. Activation energies (Ea) of the SnS nanofilms were evaluated from the slop of the curve. 0.864 eV, 0.731 eV and 0.584 eV are the measured values of the activation energies of 14 °C SnS, 30 °C SnS and 70 °C SnS nanofilm, respectively. Hegde et al. studied on SnS crystals grown by vapor deposition technique and reported activation energy 0.34 eV above 275 K. Reddy et al. showed activation energy of 0.081 eV and 0.091 eV for 0.3 μm and 0.6 μm thick SnS film. Paul et al. reported that the thermal activation energy of",

This method was previously used to avoid the long, high temperature traditional methods in the synthesis of Mg2Si, with the objective of reducing the volatilization and oxidation of Mg. The electronic transport properties are compared with those of an Sb-doped sample and previous reports on Sb-doped Mg2Ge samples fabricated by melting techniques followed by hot-pressing. A maximum zT of 0.32 at 750 K for Mg2Ge0.97Bi0.03 was obtained, which was higher than the previously reported zT value of 0.2 for Sb-doped Mg2Ge. This was achieved due to the lower thermal conductivity of this compound, originating from the bismuth-rich precipitates formed at the grain boundaries and embedded within the matrix. These results, however, suggest that there is very low solubility of Bi in Mg2Ge which limits its utility as an effective dopant.",

La0.5Co4Sb12-xTex skutterudite compounds were synthesized by a combination of the mechanical alloying technique and spark plasma sintering processing, which resulted in partial substitution of Te atoms in Sb sites. The XRD results showed that all the Te-doped bulk samples were composed of a major phase of the Co4Sb12 skutterudite with a small amount of CoSb2 and Sb as the secondary phases. Thermoelectric measurements of the consolidated samples were examined in a temperature range of 300 K to 800 K (27 °C to 527 °C). With the La0.5Co4Sb11.7Te0.3 sample, the highest absolute Seebeck coefficient of 300 μV/K was obtained at 404 K (131 °C) and the lowest lattice thermal conductivity of 2 W/mK was achieved at 501 K (228 °C). Moreover, the minimum electrical resistivity of 19.7 μΩm was recorded at 501 K (228 °C) for La0.5Co4Sb11.5Te0.5 sample. The effect of the secondary phases was negligible for the electrical resistivity, and between 0.5 to 1.6 pct for the thermal conductivity. Thus, the highest figure of merit, ZT = 0.47, was obtained at 792 K (519 °C) for La0.5Co4Sb11.5Te0.5 sample due to a significant reduction in electrical resistivity and a moderate increase in the absolute Seebeck coefficient.",

                    "context": "The remarkable advantage of BiCuOSe for TE applications is its extraordinarily low lattice thermal conductivity. It is reported that the lattice thermal conductivity of non-textured BiCuOSe is as low as 0.52–0.9 Wm-1K-1 at 300 K,,, which is much lower than that in state of the art bulk TE materials of Bi2Te3 (1.6 Wm-1K-1 at 300 K) or PbTe (2.8 Wm-1K-1 at 300 K) and even lower than that in phonon-glass electron-crystal materials of clathrates or skutterudites. Recently, some studies on the origin of low thermal conductivity of BiCuOSe have been conducted. Pei et al. have speculated that the weak chemical bonding and strong anharmonicity of bonding resulted in the low thermal conductivity. Saha has conducted a comparison study on the lattice dynamics between BiCuOSe and LaCuOSe and ascribed the low thermal conductivity of BiCuOSe to its constituent elements with high atomic mass. However, the investigation on the phonon transport properties of BiCuOSe is still relatively rare. Recently, ab initio calculation of lattice thermal conductivity has been developed by combining the first-principles calculations of interatomic force constants with solving the phonon Boltzmann transport equation iteratively. The first-principles calculations can accurately predict the phonon thermal conductivity without any assumption on phonon lifetimes and capture the transport properties of each phonon and have been used in the investigations of phonon transport properties for many materials,,,,,,.",

Doping of barium in the place of strontium increased the Seebeck coefficient of both STC and STF. Very large S value ~800 µV/K at 1100 K was obtained in the Ba0.25Sr1.75TiFeO6 double perovskite. In the temperature-dependent conductivity curve, both STC and STF showed semiconductor (dσ/dT 0) to metal-like (dσ/dT < 0) transition as evident in Figs. 5(a) and 5(d). Furthermore, the doping of Ba2+ at the Sr-site decreased the value of electrical conductivity in both STC and STF ceramics. Maximum conductivity value for STC was found to be higher than that of STF. The highest value of power factor (S2σ) was found to be ~100 µW/mK2 at 1200 K for BaxSr2-xTiCoO6 with x = 0.15 composition. In the pure STC sample, two semiconductors to metal transition peaks were found at 700 K and 1170 K, respectively, unlike the STF sample as shown in Fig. 5(a). The first semiconductor to metal transition temperature (TS–M) was found to be shifted to the higher temperature with the incorporation of Ba in the Sr-site. There could be a phase transition responsible for semiconductor to metal transition observed in STC. However, our laboratory scale high-temperature XRD did not show any peak splitting suggesting cubic phase in the whole temperature range of measurement. High-resolution XRD or neutron diffraction is required to unravel the possible phase transition in the STC sample. It is to be noted that these materials exhibited relaxor ferroelectricity as discussed in the subsequent section of this manuscript. Hence it is difficult to solve the crystal structure of BSTC since the metal–semiconductor transition temperatures belonged to the paraelectric region, which is known to possess the cubic crystal structure. Hence one may need to resolve the local structural ordering in this system.",

SnS compound and SnS1-xSex solid solutions exhibited anisotropic thermoelectric performance and showed higher power factor and thermal conductivity along the direction ⊥ than the // one. The thermal conductivity decreased with increasing contents of Se and fell to 0.36 W m-1 K-1 at 823 K for the composition SnS0.5Se0.5. With increasing selenium content (x) the formation of solid solutions substantially improved the electrical conductivity due to the increased carrier concentration. Hence, the optimized power factor and reduced thermal conductivity resulted in a maximum ZT value of 0.64 at 823 K for SnS0.2Se0.8 along the parallel direction.",

                    "context": "SnS and SnSe have received increasing attention as new thermoelectric materials with abundant resources and better environmental compatibility. These materials in their pristine form possess high Seebeck coefficient and low thermal conductivity but low electrical conductivity due to the low carrier concentration which results in low ZT values. Electrical conductivity can be enhanced by optimizing carrier concentration through elemental doping and band convergence,,, while thermal conductivity can be suppressed via forming solid solutions (alloying), nanostructure architecture and microstructure modulation,,, by virtue of intensifying phonon scattering at atomic, nano and micro scales, respectively. Among these strategies, forming solid solutions, has also been revealed as an effective way to modify the band structures: it can alter the band shape (effective mass), change the band gap (related to bipolar effect), and also affect the relative position of different bands (band alignment and convergence), thus directly determining charge transport and thermoelectric performance. Recently a ZT value up to 0.6 at 873 K was achieved in Ag–doped SnS polycrystals by Tan et al., which is 275% higher than the undoped samples. SnSe is the heavier analogue of SnS, and both crystalize in highly anisotropic layered orthorhombic structure (Pnma) at room temperature and convert to Cmcm at high temperatures,. Optical properties on the two materials has been studied extensively in the past, and recent attention has been paid to their thermoelectric properties,,. Guo et al. comparatively calculated the ZT values of SnSe and SnS using first principle and the Boltzmann transport, and found that SnSe has larger optimal ZT than SnS. Recently an unprecedented ZT of 2.6 at 973 K was observed in SnSe single crystal along b–axis due to moderate power factor and ultra–low lattice thermal conductivity. Nevertheless, due to the rigorous and low–efficiency of synthetic process of the single crystals, most of the thermoelectric materials are expected to work in polycrystalline forms, which can be synthesized through low cost powder metallurgical processes. A typical example is a combination of mechanical alloying (MA) and spark plasma sintering (SPS). The advantage of MA is to get fine powders in a short alloying time and low fabrication cost while SPS treatment can achieve high density close to the theoretical value and keeps the original microstructure using faster rate which also help to avoid the coarsening of grains.",

The σ of the SnS1-xSex solid solutions increases with rising temperature. σ⊥ of SnS is 3.24 × 10^-3 S/cm at 323 K, which is comparable to our previous studies but greatly lower than Han’s work. For solid solutions, σ is also lower than the same composition in ref.. This phenomenon is ascribed to the lower carrier concentration (nH) and mobility (μH) in this work as shown in Table 2. The lower mobility can be intuitively understood since samples here prepared by MA should contain abundant defects that act as scattering centers of carriers. The reason for the lower carrier concentration is not quite clear. We tentatively argue that the off stoichiometry, probably the existence of S deficiencies, may be important. Recalling the Seebeck coefficient as mentioned above, it is also smaller in this study, which seems to be in contrary to the common sense that a lower nH usually gives a larger S. However, this simple prediction is reliable only when the dominant scattering mechanisms are similar, which need further investigation. σ decreases with increase of Se content (x) for x = 0.2 at 323 K, which is due to the impaired carrier mobility by alloying. With even more Se, σ increases with x, which is mainly due to increased nH. It is also seen that over the whole temperature range all the SnS1-xSex solid solutions, σ// is lower than σ⊥ one due to the preferred orientation of the (400) plane in this direction, which is related to the larger effective mass and the consequentially lower carrier mobility along this direction. The highest electrical conductivities of 33.1 S/cm and 27 S/cm are obtained at 823 K for the composition SnS0.2Se0.8 along the directions ⊥ and // to the SPS–pressurizing direction, respectively. Figure 3(e) and (f) present the power factors (PF = S2σ) of all the SnS1-xSex samples versus selenium content (x). Over the entire temperature range, the PF⊥ is higher than PF//. The maximum PF⊥ and PF// of the composition SnS0.2Se0.8 at 823 K are 3.7 μW cm-1 K-2 and 2.93 μW cm-1 K-2, respectively.",

High anisotropy among all the transport properties has been observed, i.e. higher PF and σ along the direction perpendicular to the SPS–pressurizing direction than the parallel one. Se substitution subsequently increased the hole carrier concentration from 9.02 × 10^14 cm-3 in SnS to 2.10 × 10^17 cm-3 in SnS0.2Se0.8, which results in increased σ and PF. A high ZT value of 0.64 has been obtained for the composition SnS0.2Se0.8 at 823 K along the direction // to the SPS–pressuring direction due to the reduced κ and optimized PF. SnS and all the SnS1-xSex solid solutions exhibit higher thermoelectric performance along the direction parallel to the SPS–pressurizing direction than the other one. Moreover, although a low κ of 0.36 at 823 K was observed in SnS0.5Se0.5, its maximum ZT value 0.45 is still lower than the SnS0.2Se0.8 owing to its low σ and PF. However, both compositions (SnS0.5Se0.5, SnS0.2Se0.8) are promising candidates for further thermoelectric investigations towards higher performance through proper p–type doping to increase σ and PF.",

                    "context": "There have been a few experimental studies on the thermal conductivity of fullerene and its derivatives. Thermal conductivity of single crystal C60 was first measured using static one-heater, two-thermometer method and the reported values are around 0.4 W m-1 K-1 which is nearly temperature independent above 260 K. Later, 3ω method was used to characterize the thermal conductivity of a C60/C70 compact, which was shown to be 0.1 W m-1 K-1 at room temperature. Recently, fullerene derivatives were found to have ultra-low thermal conductivity, which is even lower than that of C60 solids. Duda et al. measured thermal conductivity of phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) using time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) and reported exceptionally low values around 0.03 ~ 0.06 W m-1 K-1 at room temperature. Wang et al. conducted TDTR measurements to study the thermal conductivity of fullerene C60 and its derivatives including PCBM and phenyl-C61-butyric acid n-buylester (PCBNB). They observed low thermal conductivity of PCBM and PCBNB around 0.05 ~ 0.06 W m-1 K-1. In addition, they found the thermal conductivity of disordered C60 was about 0.1 W m-1 K-1 at room temperature, nearly a factor of two larger than that of PCBM or PCBNB. As noted by both groups, the conventional minimum thermal conductivity model fails to explain the ultralow thermal conductivity of fullerene derivatives by counting the exact atomic number density in a unit cell. Considering two extremes of pure fullerene (disorder C60 films) and pure organic alkyl-chain systems (amorphous polymers), both have higher thermal conductivities than the fullerene derivatives. Therefore, fullerene derivatives such as PCBM and PCBNB cannot be simply treated as a mixture of fullerene and alkyl chains in the study of their thermal conductivity and their thermal transport mechanisms are complicated by adding the alkyl chains to buckyballs via chemical bonding. Besides, the unusual reduction of thermal conductivity was also observed in the measurements of the intercalated polymer-PCBM composite. The results showed a lower thermal conductivity of the composite than both of the constituents when the polymer volumetric fraction is below 35% and similar mechanism was suggested for the reduction of thermal conductivity.",

A thin flake was fabricated from a single crystal of Mn3Sn using a focused ion-beam system. The final processing of Ga+ ion milling was performed by a low acceleration voltage of 5 kV to reduce the damaged layer at the surface. The polished thin single crystal flake was then transferred to a thermally oxidized Si substrate by using a W needle manipulator. Then, the surface of Mn3Sn was milled by Ar dry etching to remove the residual damaged layer. The MgO/NiFe and Cu electrodes were formed by electron beam lithography and lift-off processes. The edge of the Mn3Sn flake was covered by a 30-nm-thick Al2O3 layer to avoid direct contact between the sample edge and the electrodes. The resistivity of the processed Mn3Sn crystal was 360 μΩ cm at room temperature, which is comparable to the bulk value. In addition, the metallic behaviour of the temperature dependence of the resistivity was confirmed. The MgO insertion layer was prepared by a method similar to that used in a previous study. Thus, the interfacial resistance is expected to be about 0.1 Ω μm2.",

The lattice thermal conductivity has been reduced by 60% and the minimum lattice thermal conductivity (1.2 W m-1 K-1 @ 973 K) can be reached to the theoretical minimum or amorphous limit. Hence, the highest ZT value of 0.44 at 973 K makes In2O3-based bulk ceramics a promising candidate for thermoelectric power generation applications. Our work not only deals with the higher ZT in In2O3 based system but also provides a systematic ground for improving the performance of other ceramic-based TE materials.",

Both compounds were synthesized via melting and consolidated by spark plasma sintering. The role of annealing on the transport properties of polymorphous AgBiSe2 and monophase AgSbSe2 was studied. Annealing has a greater impact on AgBiSe2 than AgSbSe2, which is ascribed to the temperature dependent phase transition of AgBiSe2. Unannealed AgBiSe2 shows p–n switching, but annealed AgBiSe2 exhibits n-type semiconducting behavior over the whole measurement temperature range. By performing high-temperature Hall measurements, we attribute this intriguing variation to the change in the amount of Ag vacancies and mid-temperature rhombohedral phase after annealing. Both AgBiSe2 and AgSbSe2 exhibit low thermal conductivity values, which are ∼0.40–0.50 W m−1 K−1 for AgSbSe2 and ∼0.45–0.70 W m−1 K−1 for AgBiSe2, respectively. The maximum ZT value of AgBiSe2 is enhanced from 0.18 to 0.21 after annealing. Pristine AgSbSe2 presents a ZT value as high as 0.60 at 623 K, although slight deterioration emerges after annealing.",

However, the power factor of AgSbSe2 decreases after annealing due to the enhancement of electrical resistivity. Unannealed AgBiSe2 and annealed AgBiSe2 have the same variation trend of power factor: it increases with increasing temperature below 480 K, then decreases in the γ phase temperature range, and finally increases again above 580 K. Although the power factor of AgBiSe2 increases after annealing in the entire temperature range, the maximum value 207 μW m−1 K−2 at 480 K is still relatively low.",

With increasing temperature, the ZT values are roughly increased until 793 K. For the pristine SnSe0.95, the maximum ZT value is ∼0.14 at 793 K. By PbBr2 doping, the ZTs are significantly increased and reach a highest value of 0.54 in SnSe0.95–3% PbBr2 at 793 K, due to the significantly enhanced electrical transport properties and the reduced thermal conductivity. It should be emphasized that a ZT of 0.54 in PbBr2-doped SnSe samples synthesized by hot pressing is a very conservative value. As the corresponding thermal conductivity (>0.6 W m−1 K−1 at 793 K) is much higher than the single crystal, there is still room to further increase the ZT of PbBr2-doped SnSe. By nanocomposites or alloys, the thermal conductivity can be decreased and the thermoelectric performance can be further improved. Recently, a report by Chang et al. shows that Pb/Br doped SnSe show a higher ZT of ∼1.2 where the thermal conductivity is reduced to 0.3 W m−1 K−1.",

Our polycrystalline SnSe0.95–PbBr2 samples show higher thermoelectric performance in the direction perpendicular to the pressure. As a result of detailed analysis, the DOS effective mass of PbBr2-doped sample is larger than the previously reported n-type SnSe, leading to an enhanced Seebeck coefficient with electrical conductivity less affected.

This compound also exhibits Fe/Ti substitution according to Ti1+xFe1.33−xSb (−0.17 ≤ x ≤ 0.25 at 800 °C). Its stability, crystal symmetry and site preference were established by using X-ray powder techniques and were backed by DFT calculations. The ab initio modeling revealed TiFe1.375Sb to be the most stable composition and established the mechanisms behind Fe/Ti substitution for the region Ti1+xFe1.33−xSb, and of the Fe/Co substitution within the isopleth TiFe1.33Sb–TiCoSb. The calculated residual resistivity of Ti1+xFe1.33−xSb, as well as of the isopleths TiFe1.33Sb–TiCoSb, TiFe0.665Co0.5Sb–TiCoSb0.75Sn0.25 and TiFe0.33Co0.75Sb–TiCoSb0.75Sn0.25, are in a good correlation with the experimental data. From magnetic measurements and 57Fe Mössbauer spectrometry, a paramagnetic behavior down to 4.2 K was observed for TiFe1.33Sb, with a paramagnetic Curie–Weiss temperature of −8 K and an effective moment of 1.11μB per Fe. Thermoelectric (TE) properties were obtained for the four isopleths Ti1+xFe1.33−xSb, TiFe1.33Sb–TiCoSb, TiFe0.665Co0.5Sb–TiCoSb0.75Sn0.25 and TiFe0.29Co0.78Sb–TiCoSb0.75Sn0.25 by measurements of electrical resistivity (ρ), Seebeck coefficient (S) and thermal conductivity (λ) at temperatures from 300 K to 823 K allowing the calculation of the dimensionless figure of merit (ZT). Although p-type Ti1+xFe1.33−xSb indicates a semi-conducting behavior for the Fe rich composition (x = −0.133), the conductivity changes to a metallic type with increasing Ti content. The highest ZT = 0.3 at 800 K was found for the composition TiFe1.33Sb. The TE performance also increases with Fe/Co substitution and reaches ZT = 0.42 for TiCo0.5Fe0.665Sb. No further increase of the TE performance was observed for the Sb/Sn substituted compounds within the sections TiFe0.665Co0.5Sb–TiCoSb0.75Sn0.25 and TiFe0.33Co0.75Sb–TiCoSb0.75Sn0.25. However, ZT-values could be enhanced by about 12% via the optimization of the preparation route (ball-mill conditions and heat treatments).",

                    "context": "Half Heusler (HH) alloys have attracted considerable interest as thermoelectric (TE) materials in the temperature range around 700 K and above, which is close to the temperature range of most industrial waste heat sources. HH compounds crystallize in the cubic MgAgAs structure-type, space group F3m, forming three interpenetrating face-centered cubic (fcc) sublattices and one vacant sublattice. In view of the Zintl mechanism, HH materials with 18 valence electrons were shown to exhibit semiconducting properties. A great advantage in the optimization of the thermoelectric properties of HH compounds is the possibility to individually dope each of these sublattices. The most attractive properties of HH materials for thermoelectrics are their high Seebeck coefficient S up to 300 μV K−1 at room temperature and their high electrical conductivity (100 to 1000 S cm−1); however, the drawback of HH alloys is their relatively high thermal conductivity reaching up to 10 W mK−1 at room temperature. Many HH compounds were investigated in the past with the aim to improve their thermoelectric properties. So far the highest ZT = 1.5 has been reported by Sakurada and Shutoh for Sb-doped n-type Ti0.5Zr0.25Hf0.25NiSn0.998Sb0.002 at 690 K and by Rogl et al. at a slightly higher temperature of 825 K. Schwall and Balke obtained ZT = 1.2 at 830 K via intrinsic phase separation in Ti0.5Zr0.25Hf0.25NiSn0.998Sb0.002. More recent attempts have succeeded in obtaining a ZT of ∼1.35 for n-type Ti0.15Zr0.25Hf0.65NiSn0.995Sb0.005 with nano-dispersed ZrO2 and for (Zr0.40Hf0.60)0.00V0.01NiSn0.998Sb0.002 with vanadium resonant states. For commercial thermoelectric applications, however, the high priced Hf-metal needs to be avoided. Therefore, it is interesting to note that for the Hf-free grades Ti0.5Zr0.5NiSn0.98Sb0.02 and Ti0.50Zr0.48Nb0.02NiSn0.98Sb0.02, a ZT = 1.2 was obtained with a thermoelectric efficiency η300–800 K > 11%. A significant progress was also made for p-type Nb1−xHfxFeSb with ZTmax ≈ 1.5 at 1200 K (ref. 15) and for the Hf free Ti-substituted solid solution Nb1−xTixFeSb. During our study of thermoelectric alloys in the section NbFeSb–TiFeSb, we noticed the absence of transport properties of the parent compound TiFeSb, which also served as the base for Fe/Co and Sb/Sn substituted thermoelectric materials. The Fe/Co substitution in TiFexCo1−xSb results in a significant increase of ZT from 0.05 for TiCoSb to 0.42 for TiFe0.3Co0.7Sb. These values are close to that reported for Sb/Sn substituted TiCoSb0.8Sn0.2 (ZTmax = 0.5 at 700 K (ref. 21)). In addition, a DFT calculation of Ti/Fe substitution in Ti1−xFexCoSb indicated a decrease of ZT from",

First, rock-salt-structured (Ca,Mn1−x,Nbx)O thin films were deposited on 100 sapphire using reactive RF magnetron co-sputtering from elemental targets of Ca, Mn and Nb. The CaMn1−xNbxO3 films were then obtained by thermally induced phase transformation from rock-salt-structured (Ca,Mn1−xNbx)O to orthorhombic during post-deposition annealing at 700 °C for 3 h in oxygen flow. The X-ray diffraction patterns of pure CaMnO3 showed mixed orientation, while Nb-containing films were epitaxially grown in [101] out of-plane-direction. Scanning transmission electron microscopy showed a Ruddlesden–Popper (R–P) secondary phase in the films, which results in reduction of the electrical and thermal conductivity of CaMn1−xNbxO3. The electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient of the pure CaMnO3 film were measured to 2.7 Ω cm and −270 μV K−1 at room temperature, respectively. The electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient were reduced by alloying with Nb and was measured to 0.09 Ω cm and −145 μV K−1 for x = 0.05. Yielding a power factor of 21.5 μW K−2 m−1 near room temperature, nearly eight times higher than for pure CaMnO3 (2.8 μW K−2 m−1). The power factors for alloyed samples are low compared to other studies on phase-pure material. This is due to high electrical resistivity originating from the secondary R–P phase. The thermal conductivity of the CaMn1−xNbxO3 films is low for all samples and is the lowest for x = 0.07 and 0.10, determined to 1.6 W m−1 K−1. The low thermal conductivity is attributed to grain boundary scattering and the secondary R–P phase.",

This value is substantially higher than our measured values. However, a theoretical overestimation is expected since our calculations treat a perfect defect free bulk CaMnO3. The films are not free of defects, e.g. point defects, line defects and grain boundaries, which can act as strong scattering sources for phonons, reducing thermal conductivity. In our study, the thermal conductivity of the pure CaMnO3 film is measured to 2.2 W m−1 K−1 at room temperature, which is lower than the reported values from other studies. This difference in thermal conductivity can be attributed to the variation in film growth method, resulting in different grain distribution in the film. Conventionally, CaMnO3 is grown by solid state reaction method, which results in large grain size, reducing the scattering probability of phonons at grain interfaces. Fig. 7 shows the cumulative thermal conductivity of CaMnO3 at 300 K as a function of the mean free path. This shows that the phonons that carry heat have a mean free path between a fraction of a nanometer to roughly 400 nm. The dashed line marks the 40 nm mean free path, which corresponds to the apparent grain size (from SEM, Fig. 2) in our films. The small differences in grain size between samples are neglectable for phonon scattering as changing the grain size by 25% results in less than 5% change in available phonons for efficient scattering, see Fig. 7. More than 35% of the heat-carrying phonons have a mean free path longer than 40 nm. Thus, they should be affected by grain boundary scattering, resulting in a reduction of the thermal conductivity. This means that we see two different contributions to the overall reduction of the thermal conductivity, grain boundary scattering and the R–P phase. However, we also see a decrease in thermal conductivity with increasing Nb content in the films. We propose that the thermal conductivity is reduced by the scattering of phonons on heavy Nb atoms in the lattice where more Nb leads to higher chance of scattering events. Our results thus suggest that the thermal conductivity can be controlled by microstructure optimization or by introducing a R–P secondary phase, where microstructure optimization is the preferred route for thermoelectric applications because the R–P phase reduces the electrical conductivity.",

These thermal conductivity values are lower compared to most other reported values. The low thermal conductivity of our thin film is attributed to the grain boundary scattering of phonons, as due to the low grain size (40 nm) of the films, and a R–P secondary phase in the films.",

The resistivity of the CaMn1−xNbxO3 (x = 0.06) thin film is the lowest at 0.08 Ω cm near room temperature. Which is nearly 33 times lower than the value for the pure CaMnO3 thin film (2.70 Ω cm). The Seebeck coefficient of pure CaMnO3 thin film is measured to −270 μV K−1 near room temperature, whereas the alloyed films vary within the range −145 μV K−1 and −120 μV K−1 near room temperature. The highest room temperature power factor value is 21.6 μW K−2 m−1, obtained from the CaMn1−xNbxO3 (x = 0.05) film, which is 8 times higher than the pure CaMnO3 thin film with a 2.7 μW K−2 m−1 power factor. Although the electrical resistivity is substantially reduced by Nb alloying, it is comparatively high if compared to other studies on phase-pure material. This is true for the power factor as well (note that the power factor is low compared to other studies).",

It has been frequently reported to have a zT higher than one at room temperature. In 2008, Ren's group successfully made nanostructured bismuth antimony tellurium alloys prepared by SPS, and a peak zT of 1.3 in the temperature range of 348 and 373 K was achieved. Later, Xie et al. prepared Bi–Sb–Te samples with nano-domains and coherent boundaries using melt spinning technique together with SPS resulting in a significant improvement of zT to a value of 1.5 at 390 K. In 2015, Kim et al. introduced dense dislocation arrays embedded in grain boundaries which effectively reduced the lattice thermal conductivity and an enhancement of zT up to 1.86 at 320 K was achieved.",

Li3Co1.06(1)TeO6 crystallizes orthorhombically with the following unit cell parameters and refinement results: Fddd, a = 588.6(2), b = 856.7(2), c = 1781.5(4) pm, R1 = 0.0174, wR2 = 0.0462, 608 F2 values, and 33 variables. Additional electron density in tetrahedral voids in combination with neighboring face-linked and under-occupied octahedral lithium sites offers an excellent possible diffusion pathway for lithium ions. According to the symmetry of the crystal structure the diffusion pathways in Li3Co1.06(1)TeO6 were found in two orthogonal orientations. The CoII/CoIII mixed valence was investigated via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), revealing a composition comparable to that derived from single-crystal X-ray diffractometry. Magnetic susceptibility measurements underlined the coexistence of CoII and CoIII, the title compound, however, showed no magnetic ordering down to low temperatures. The ionic conductivity of Li3Co1.06(1)TeO6 was determined via alternating current (AC) electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and was found to be in the range of 1.6 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 573 K.",

This value is about two orders of magnitude higher than the grain boundary conductivity σgb of 1.64 × 10−6 S cm−1 measured for Li3Co1.06(1)TeO6 at 523 K. The differences in conductivity may be explained by changes in the lattice polarization (NiII instead of CoIII), changes in the lithium coordination geometries (significant occupation of tetrahedral voids) and site occupation. Comparable values were found for the lithium-containing garnets Li3Ln3Te2O12 (Ln = Y, Pr, Nd, Sm–Lu) with a maximum value of 1 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 873 K measured for the neodymium compound. In crystalline solids, the highest reported Li+ conductivities of about 1 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature have been realized in a perovskite-type lithium lanthanum titanate.",

It is urgent to develop n-type counterparts for high efficiency thermoelectric modules based on these copper based-chalcogenides. Cu4Sn7S16 is an intrinsically n-type semiconductor with complex crystal structure and low thermal conductivity. However, its thermoelectric properties have not been well studied when compared to the well-known n-type CuFeS2. In this work, high-quality Cu4Sn7S16-based compounds are fabricated and their thermoelectric properties are systematically studied. Using Ag and Sb as dopants, the carrier concentration is tuned over a wide range. The electrical transport properties can be well described by the single parabolic band model with carrier acoustic phonons scattering. It is revealed that Cu4Sn7S16 exhibits a low effective mass and relatively high mobility. The thermal conductivity is lower than 0.8 W m−1 K−1 from 300 to 700 K and shows a weak dependence on temperature. A maximum zT of 0.27 is obtained in Cu3.97Ag0.03Sn7S16 at 700 K. Further enhancement of thermoelectric performance is possible when a more efficient n-type dopant is used.",
