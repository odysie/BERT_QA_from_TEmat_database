In summary, our work on heavily doped In2O3 nanostructured ceramics demonstrates that modulating point defects improve the electrical conductivity and suppress the lattice thermal conductivity, simultaneously. The lattice thermal conductivity has been reduced by 60% and the minimum lattice thermal conductivity (1.2 W m-1 K-1 @ 973 K) can be reached to the theoretical minimum or amorphous limit. Hence, the highest ZT value of 0.44 at 973 K makes In2O3-based bulk ceramics a promising candidate for thermoelectric power generation applications. Our work not only deals with the higher ZT in In2O3 based system but also provides a systematic ground for improving the performance of other ceramic-based TE materials.
