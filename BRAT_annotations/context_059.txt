The lattice thermal conductivity of Ag16.7Sb30Te53.3 is very low (0.6–0.7 W m−1 K−1) at room temperature, which suggests that the phonon mean free path of high fequency phonons is already fully suppressed by the thermal motion of the atoms []. Thus, additional phonon scattering processes focusing on low frequency phonons must be introduced beyond phonon-phonon processes when aiming at increasing the figure of merit of this material.
