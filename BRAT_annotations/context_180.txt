New materials for thermoelectric applications are investigated by the researchers studying in the field of thermoelectricity. One of the materials with high thermoelectric performance is Ca–Al–Sb discovered by Toberer et al.. After this discovery, it is pointed out that Ca-Al-Sb alloys with different stoichiometry have also high thermoelectric performance. For example, Seebeck coefficient of Ca5Al2Sb6 is larger than 450 μV/K at room temperature. The other is Ca3AlSb3 which possesses the Seebeck coefficient almost 200 μV/K at room temperature. In the Sr3GaSb3 obtained by modifying the Ca3AlSb3 system, the Seebeck coefficient is around 200 μV/K. Different elements, such as Zn, Mn, Yb, Eu, Ga, In, as etc., were partially doped/substituted to improve the thermoelectric performance of the systems.
