It is well known that transition metal oxides with variable valence is a kind of typical electrode materials in pseudocapacitors including cobalt oxides [], manganese oxides [,] and nickel oxides []. However, the main drawback of these metal oxides electrode was their poor electrical conductivity, limiting their performance. For example the electrical conductivity of Co3O4 oxide was only 1.96 × 10−5 S cm−1 at room temperature []. To improve on the shortcoming, one viable approach was to incorporate these metal oxides directly into highly conductive substrates to fabricate hybrid supercapacitor electrodes [,,,]. On the other hand, the search for alternative materials to metal oxides have overwhelmingly focused on numerous mixed metal oxides because of their relative high conductivity and reversible faradaic surface, such as LaNiO3 [], (La0.75Sr0.25)0.95MnO3-δ [], SrRuO3 [], La0.5Sr0.5Cu0.1Mn0.9O3-δ [], ZnCo2O4 [], and MnCo2O4 [].
