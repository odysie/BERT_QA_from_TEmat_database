Furthermore, we studied the effect of barium doping at A-site on TE properties of STC and STF. Doping of barium in the place of strontium increased the Seebeck coefficient of both STC and STF. Very large S value ~800 µV/K at 1100 K was obtained in the Ba0.25Sr1.75TiFeO6 double perovskite. In the temperature-dependent conductivity curve, both STC and STF showed semiconductor (dσ/dT 0) to metal-like (dσ/dT < 0) transition as evident in Figs. 5(a) and 5(d). Furthermore, the doping of Ba2+ at the Sr-site decreased the value of electrical conductivity in both STC and STF ceramics. Maximum conductivity value for STC was found to be higher than that of STF. The highest value of power factor (S2σ) was found to be ~100 µW/mK2 at 1200 K for BaxSr2-xTiCoO6 with x = 0.15 composition. In the pure STC sample, two semiconductors to metal transition peaks were found at 700 K and 1170 K, respectively, unlike the STF sample as shown in Fig. 5(a). The first semiconductor to metal transition temperature (TS–M) was found to be shifted to the higher temperature with the incorporation of Ba in the Sr-site. There could be a phase transition responsible for semiconductor to metal transition observed in STC. However, our laboratory scale high-temperature XRD did not show any peak splitting suggesting cubic phase in the whole temperature range of measurement. High-resolution XRD or neutron diffraction is required to unravel the possible phase transition in the STC sample. It is to be noted that these materials exhibited relaxor ferroelectricity as discussed in the subsequent section of this manuscript. Hence it is difficult to solve the crystal structure of BSTC since the metal–semiconductor transition temperatures belonged to the paraelectric region, which is known to possess the cubic crystal structure. Hence one may need to resolve the local structural ordering in this system.
