By optimizing the Sn concentration, high power factors can be obtained for ZrCoBi1-xSnx (Fig. 3c). The room temperature power factor is ~25 µW cm-1 K-2 and the peak power factor reaches ~40 µW cm-1 K-2 for ZrCoBi0.80Sn0.20. In addition, Sn-doped TiCoSb and ZrCoSb (both were prepared in this work with identical approach) with similar Hall carier concentration are also ploted for comparison. As shown in Fig. 3c, ZrCoBi0.75Sn0.15 and ZrCoBi0.80Sn0.20 show noticeably higher power factors than that of Sn-doped ZrCoSb and TiCoSb. Band-degeneracy-dependent power factor at different temperatures is further plotted for the three compounds, as shown in Fig. 3d. The power factor increases monotonically with the band degeneracy at all of the temperatures. This unambiguously demonstrates that band degeneracy plays a pivotal role in the power factor. In other words, the high power factor achieved in ZrCoBi-based compounds should be mainly ascribed to the high band degeneracy for this compound as indicated by the theoretical calculations (Fig. 2b).
