Oxides of Rh3+ behave as classical semiconductors where the conduction band is a 4d eg band, the valence band is a 4d t2g band, and the band gap is about 2.2 eV. For oxides of Rh4+ the 4d t2g band is 83% filled, and electrical conductivity measurements indicate itinerant electron behavior in RhO2, SrRhO3, Sr4Rh3O10, Sr3Rh2O7, and Sr2RhO4. One might then expect that (Bi6O5)Rh12O24 could be metallic with a 95% filled 4d t2g band. Although (Bi6O5)Rh12O24 is a good electrical conductor, its conductivity is actually several orders of magnitude less than expected for a metal. Furthermore, its temperature dependence of conductivity is the opposite expected for a metal, and the high Seebeck coefficient is typical of a semiconductor rather than a metal. Finally, our magnetic susceptibility measurements show the presence of a localized moment. A similar temperature dependence of conductivity with a room temperature of 67 S/cm was observed for Ba1.21Bi0.33Rh8O16 with the Hollandite structure . A room temperature conductivity of 0.1 S/cm was found for crystals of p-type LuRhO3, and a room temperature conductivity of 0.7 S/cm was found for films of p-type ZnRh2O4. Because both of these materials were p-type, they may be regarded as a Rh3+/Rh4+ mixed-valent compounds containing only a small amount of Rh4+.
