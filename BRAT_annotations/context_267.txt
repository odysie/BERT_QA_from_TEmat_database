Fig. 6 displays the ZT values as a function of temperature for SnSe0.95–x% PbBr2 (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4). With increasing temperature, the ZT values are roughly increased until 793 K. For the pristine SnSe0.95, the maximum ZT value is ∼0.14 at 793 K. By PbBr2 doping, the ZTs are significantly increased and reach a highest value of 0.54 in SnSe0.95–3% PbBr2 at 793 K, due to the significantly enhanced electrical transport properties and the reduced thermal conductivity. It should be emphasized that a ZT of 0.54 in PbBr2-doped SnSe samples synthesized by hot pressing is a very conservative value. As the corresponding thermal conductivity (>0.6 W m−1 K−1 at 793 K) is much higher than the single crystal, there is still room to further increase the ZT of PbBr2-doped SnSe. By nanocomposites or alloys, the thermal conductivity can be decreased and the thermoelectric performance can be further improved. Recently, a report by Chang et al. shows that Pb/Br doped SnSe show a higher ZT of ∼1.2 where the thermal conductivity is reduced to 0.3 W m−1 K−1.
