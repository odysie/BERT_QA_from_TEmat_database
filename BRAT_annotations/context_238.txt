The effective mass, defined as a second-order tensor, can be expressed as a scalar m* with the assumption of a single parabolic band which results in a spherical Fermi surface in k-space. Tuning the flatness of a single valley (adjusting mb*) offers us another opportunity to optimize TE properties in the framework of valleytronics. Normally, lower mb* is more favorable for TE materials, which could be seen from Eq. (2) and shown by both experiments and theory. The study on p-type (V,Nb)FeSb-based materials, a kind of HH alloys with excellent TE performance in the high temperature range (T 1000 K), serves as a good example. DFT calculations show that VFeSb possesses a flatter valence band than that of NbFeSb. Therefore, the mb* of (V,Nb)FeSb solid solutions is expected to become lower with increasing Nb content. Experimental work indeed confirms that NbFeSb has much lower mb* (1.6 me) than that of (V0.6Nb0.4)FeSb (2.5 me), as shown in Fig. 8a. Furthermore, in this HH material system, the decreased mb* also helps lower the optimal carrier concentration, which was too high to reach in (V0.6Nb0.4)FeSb within the solid solubility of Ti dopant (Fig. 8b). The hole mobility gets doubled and contributes to a high PF (~45 Î¼W cm-1 K-2 at 900 K) as well as an enhanced zT (~1.1) in Ti-doped NbFeSb.
