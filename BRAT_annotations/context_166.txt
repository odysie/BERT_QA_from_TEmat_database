Here, we report the high TE performance of hole doped and highly textured SnSe thin films fabricated by a low-cost and scalable solution process. The highest power factor of p-type SnSe thin films reached 4.27 Î¼Wcm-1 K-2 at 550 K, higher than reported values of SnSe single crystals. Such high TE performances of the solution-processed SnSe thin film were achieved by the synergistic effect of textured microstructure, controlled compositions, and film continuity, which were realized through the non-hydrazine synthesis of molecular SnSe-based chalcogenidometallate (ChaM) and the controlled transition from a two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide SnSe2 phase to a SnSe phase.
