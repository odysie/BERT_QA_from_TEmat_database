a and 3b, respectively. Typically, for pristine MnBi4S7, electrical conductivity slightly increases as temperature increases from 300 K to 375 K, showing a semiconducting behavior, and then decreases above 375 K as the degenerate character takes over. For Mn1.03Bi4S7, σ declines from about 7.25 × 10^3 S m−1 at 300 K to 1.58 × 10^3 at 770 K while the value of σ near 300 K increases dramatically to 1.73 × 10^4 S m−1 for S-deficient MnBi4S6.86 sample, which should be ascribed to the enlarged carrier concentration in this sample, which is confirmed by the results of Hall carrier concentration measurement listed in
