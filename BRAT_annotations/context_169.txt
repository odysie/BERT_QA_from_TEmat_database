Among the various kinds of thermoelectric materials, SiGe alloys, used in thermoelectric power generators for space flights, have been attracting much attention. SiGe alloys were considered as potential thermoelectric materials for their wide energy gaps and low thermal conductivities. The physical properties were found to be closely dependent on the compositions of the alloys. Hence, composition adjustment could be practiced in an attempt to manipulate the performances of SiGe alloys. Conventional dopants (B, P, GaP, AlP, etc) were reported to be useful in tailoring the figure of merit (ZT). For example, the p-type SiGe alloys applied to radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) were reported to have a peak ZT ~0.5 (at 850 °C). The peak of ZT has reached 0.95 (at 800 °C) in p-type nanostructured SiGe bulk alloys. Being the promising dopant, rare earth, has frequently been reported to play an important role in enhancing ZT of other thermoelectric materials, but less so in SiGe alloys. Gibbons’ group found that the deep-donor-like centers most probably were produced by rare earth impurities in Tm- and Nd-doped Si crystals. The Tm and Yb dopants exhibited as deep donors in the Si lattice, but were of little use due to the low solubilities. It is therefore believed that, adding rare earth elements to the bulk SiGe alloys could have similar effects on improving their comprehensive properties. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of small amount of Er addition on the transport properties of Si80Ge20B0.6 alloys, among which particular focus was placed on its influences on the electrical performance since significant enhancement of the carrier concentration was observed.
