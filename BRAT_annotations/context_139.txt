In the past decades, zone-melted (ZM) bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) based alloys have become the best commercial TE materials. ZM Bi2Te3-based alloys are mainly used in the solid-state refrigeration because of high zT values of ∼1 near room temperature []. With the increasing energy consumption, Bi2Te3 based alloys have drawn increasing interest for power generation applications below 700 K. P-type Bi2Te3-based alloys for this purpose have exhibited high TE performance. For example, Hu et al. obtained a high zT of ∼1.3 at 380 K for p-type polycrystalline Bi0.3Sb1.7Te3 alloys [] and a maximum zT of ∼0.92 at 710 K for p-type Ag0.01Sb1.85In0.15Te3 alloy []. Xu et al. successfully upshifted the service temperature of p-type (Bi,Sb)2Te3, and a peak value of zT of ∼1.4 was attained at 500 K in Bi0.3Sb1.625In0.075Te3 []. As for n-type Bi2Te3-based alloys for power generation, Pan et al. fabricated textured n-type Bi2(Te,Se)3 materials with a maximum zT exceeding 1.1 at 473 K []; Wang et al. reported a peak zT value of ∼0.86 at 600 K in n-type zone melted Bi2Te1.5Se1.5 []; Meanwhile, Liu et al. achieved a high zT of ∼0.8 at 573 K in n-type Bi2Te2S prepared by ball-milling and hot-pressing []. However, the current n-type performance cannot match the p-type counterparts in the range of 500–700 K. Therefore, this work is focused on high performance n-type Bi2Te3-based alloys for power generation at higher temperatures.
