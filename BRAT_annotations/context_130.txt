As shown in (a), Ag9TlTe5 exhibits a complex hexagonal crystal structure with the space group R-3 c. The hexagonal lattice parameters a = 1.1431 nm and c = 4.1945 nm. The unit cell of Ag9TlTe5 is large and extremely complex, containing 12 molecules and 180 atoms . The electrical resistivity of Ag9TlTe5 decreases with temperature across the whole temperature range, indicating a semiconducting character. The resistivity value at 700 K is 2.63 × 10−2 Ω-cm, (b), which is more than an order of magnitude higher than those of state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials. The Seebeck coefficient first decreases with temperature, reaching a minimum at around 650 K, and then increases with temperature up to 700 K. The Seebeck coefficient value of Ag9TlTe5 at 700 K is 319 μV/K, as shown in (c). The maximum power factor of 3.87 μW/cmK2 was obtained at 700 K, (d). Although its power factor is lower than those of state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials, Ag9TlTe5 exhibits a very high ZT value of 1.23 ((f)) at 700 K because of its extremely low thermal conductivity , whose value at room temperature is about 0.23 W/mK, only one-fifth of that for pure Bi2Te3. The temperature dependence of thermal conductivity is rather weak, as shown in (e), resembling a glass-like limit. To explore the reason behind the low thermal conductivity of Ag9TlTe5, the elastic properties were then characterized. The average sound velocity, Young's modulus, and Debye temperature are 1203 ms−1, 23.4 GPa and 120 K, respectively. These values are very low compared with those of state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials . For example, the Debye temperatures for Bi2Te3 and PbTe are 165 K and 160 K, respectively. The low Young's modulus and Debye temperature of Ag9TlTe5 are attributable to its weak interatomic bonding. The above data well satisfied the requirements for a low thermal conductivity: a large molecular weight, a complex crystal structure, nondirectional bonding, and a large number of different atoms per molecule .
