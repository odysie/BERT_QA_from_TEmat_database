Here, we present the initiative work about the successful fabrication of nonstoichiometric TiO2-x by HPHT. And combining the use of coarse (about 48 μm) Ti and fine (about 25 nm) TiO2 with appropriate HPHT reactive sintering parameters, multi-scale hierarchical TiO2-x was achieved in just two hours, in addition to ubiquitous lattice defects brought about by HPHT, such as dislocations and lattice deformations. As a result for titanium oxide prepared by HPHT, an encouraging zT value of up to 0.33 at 700 °C was reported here. The reasons why thermoelectric performance can be substantially enhanced by our innovative strategy are discussed.
