In this work, skutterudite thermoelectric materials with high performance were prepared by using non-toxic, non-polluting elements with abundant reserves and stable performance. The formation of uniformly distributed GaSb nano-dispersions in n-type filled skutterudite was realized by controlling the metastable Ga fillers through a proper annealing process. As a result, the highest ZT of 0.56 was achieved at 623 K for Ga0.2Co4Sb12.3, which was ∼3 times that of CoSb3 at 610 K [] and was also ∼3 times that of Ga0.25Co4Sb12 prepared by conventional quenching method []. Furthermore, with the significantly increase of carrier concentration caused by Te-doping, the bipolar effect of Ga-filled skutterudite was enormously suppressed, which led to a great decrease in thermal conductivity and a great increase in power factor of Ga0.2Co4Sb11.3Te. The thermal conductivity of Ga0.2Co4Sb11.3Te was ∼2.8 Wm−1K−1 at 873 K, which was 30% lower than that of Ga0.2Co4Sb12.3, and the power factor enhanced to ten times, which increased from ∼5 × 10−4 Wm−1K−2 for Ga0.2Co4Sb12.3 to 50 × 10−4 Wm−1K−2 for Ga0.2Co4Sb11.3Te. As a result, the thermoelectric properties of Ga0.2Co4Sb11.3Te were effectively improved over the whole temperature range studied, and the highest ZT of 1.48 was achieved.
