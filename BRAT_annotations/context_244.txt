Figure 3 displays the temperature dependence of the electrical transport properties for all PbxSb1-xCrSe3 (x=0.0, 0.01, 0.03 and 0.05) compounds. In Figure 3a, SbCrSe3 exhibits a low electrical conductivity at room temperature but increases with increasing temperature because of the thermal activation of the intrinsic carriers. In the Pb-doped SbCrSe3 compounds, Pb behaved like an effective p-type dopant and each Pb atom that substituted for Sb was expected to contribute one hole to the valence band of SbCrSe3. Consequently, Pb doping led to a markedly enhanced electrical conductivity. The electrical conductivity σ significantly increased from 0.054 S m-1 at 300 K in the pristine SbCrSe3 to 1586.1 S m-1 at 300 K for the Pb-doped sample at x=0.05. Figure 3b shows the Hall carrier concentration p and carrier mobility μ for the Pb-doped compounds at room temperature. Pristine SbCrSe3 has a low hole carrier concentration of p~2.2 × 10^16 cm-3. As expected, the concentration of holes dramatically increased upon doping with Pb and reached p~0.9 × 10^19 cm-3 and p~4.5 × 10^19 cm-3 for compounds with Pb contents of x=0.01, 0.03 and 0.05, respectively. Although the mobility of holes is low in the range of 1.5–2.3 cm2 V-1 s-1, an interesting rising trend with the content of Pb up to x=0.03 was demonstrated. This trend is likely due to the disruption of localized Cr 3d orbitals upon Pb doping on the Sb site. The mobility values are comparable to those measured on doped MnSb2Se4 but are lower than the mobilities of the state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials BiCuSeO and alpha-MgAgSb. In SbCrSe3, we ascribed low mobilities to the strong scattering of the charge carriers (holes), the natural low dimensionality of the crystal structure and the spatially localized nature of Cr 3d orbitals.
