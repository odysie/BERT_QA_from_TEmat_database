b shows the total (κtot) and lattice (κl) thermal conductivity, we can see that both parameters show declining tendency with increasing SiO2 content at room and high temperature. As temperature increases, κl decreases downward to a plateau (around 0.6 W/m/K) before 600 K for most samples containing SiO2. The SiO2 addition with multiple effects from the abundant nanopores, interfaces, refined grains, and SiO2 nanoparticles induces the decrease of κl values.
