More high-performance diamond-like materials are ternary systems. Cu2SnSe3 is a p-type semiconductor with a narrow gap and can crystallize into a cubic (F-43 m) or monoclinic (Cc) phase. Shi et al. [] found that the Cu-Se bonds form an electrically conductive framework, and Sn atoms reside in the framework and donate electrons to balance the structure. This is a typical PGEC structure. By In substitution for Sn, a high zT of 1.14 at 850 K was achieved. Bulk (Ag, In)-co-doped Cu2SnSe3 samples were prepared via a high pressure combustion synthesis by Li et al. [] Ag-doping at Cu site enhances the Seebeck coefficient and increases zT to 0.80 at 773 K for Cu1.85Ag0.15SnSe3. The low electrical conductivity caused by Ag-doping was repaired by In-doping at Sn site, yielding the maximum zT = 1.42 in Cu1.85Ag0.15Sn0.9In0.1Se3 at 823 K. Other ternary Cu-based selenides also exhibit decent zT values. In sections and , we will present two typical high-performance compounds: Cu3SbSe4 composed of earth-abundant and low-cost elements (), and n-type AgInSe2.
