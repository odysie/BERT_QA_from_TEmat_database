 shows the temperature dependence of Seebeck coefficient for materials Ce1−xSrxZnSbO. All the samples indicate positive Seebeck coefficient, implying that the electrical transport properties are dominated by holes. With the increasing Sr doping content, the Seebeck coefficient decreases over the whole temperature region due to the introduction of holes. The Seebeck coefficient of CeZnSbO (129 μV/K at 330 K) is generally smaller than that of BiCuSeO (350 μV/K at 293 K), and the electrical conductivity of CeZnSbO (1300 S m−1 at 330 K) is much larger compared to that of BiCuSeO (470 S m−1 at 293 K) . This is an indication that the band gap of pristine CeZnSbO should be much smaller than that of pristine BiCuSeO. The thermoelectric power factor (PF) of Ce1−xSrxZnSbO samples were calculated and shown in
