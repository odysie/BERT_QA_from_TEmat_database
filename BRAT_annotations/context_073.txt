, electrical resistivity is sensitive to the composition and microstructure. The electrical resistivity of β-Zn4Sb3 is around 2.2×10−5 Ωm at room temperature and increases slightly with temperature. This behaviour is in good agreement with the reported one . ZnSb is a semiconductor and its room temperature electrical resistivity ( and
