Copper doped MoS2 was prepared by hydrothermal method and their thermoelectric properties were investigated. The results suggest a significant enhancement in electrical conductivity for 7.5 wt% Cu doped samples. This variation may be due to the intrinsic conduction in MC7.5 rather than ionic. The direct relation of Seebeck and electrical conductivity can be due to the presence of voids or due to the interaction of carriers with each other. The maximum electrical conductivity obtained around 14.20 Sm−1 and power factor of 0.313 µW cm−1K−2 at 420 K for 7.5 wt% Cu-doped MoS2.
