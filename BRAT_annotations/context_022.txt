For the first single doping modification method, the effects on the thermoelectric properties of CaMnO3 doped at the Mn sites by Ru, Mo, Ta, and Nb, etc., are studied by different research groups. The CaMn1 − xRuxO3 and CaMn1 − yMoyO3 systems exhibit relative low resistivities (ρ < 0.03 Ω cm) and moderate absolute thermopower values at room temperature (Seebeck coefficient S > 100 μV/K) . In a CaMn1 − xNbxO3 system, it is found that the manganite phases exhibit a structural transition from orthorhombic to cubic symmetry at high temperatures . This transition in structure resulted in obvious changes in the electrical and thermal transport properties. And the “chimie douce” (SC) synthesis is also applied to improve the thermoelectric properties of CaMn1 − xNbxO3 compounds . Thermal conductivity values were achieved for the SC-derived phases (κ < 1 W m−1 K−1). The low thermal conductivity combined with high the power factors resulted in a zT value of 0.32.
