The addition of Nb reduces the electrical resistivity of the CaMnO3 thin films. The resistivity of the CaMn1−xNbxO3 (x = 0.06) thin film is the lowest at 0.08 Ω cm near room temperature. Which is nearly 33 times lower than the value for the pure CaMnO3 thin film (2.70 Ω cm). The Seebeck coefficient of pure CaMnO3 thin film is measured to −270 μV K−1 near room temperature, whereas the alloyed films vary within the range −145 μV K−1 and −120 μV K−1 near room temperature. The highest room temperature power factor value is 21.6 μW K−2 m−1, obtained from the CaMn1−xNbxO3 (x = 0.05) film, which is 8 times higher than the pure CaMnO3 thin film with a 2.7 μW K−2 m−1 power factor. Although the electrical resistivity is substantially reduced by Nb alloying, it is comparatively high if compared to other studies on phase-pure material. This is true for the power factor as well (note that the power factor is low compared to other studies).
