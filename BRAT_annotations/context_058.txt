Several approaches were applied to reduce κl in AgSbTe2- based compounds. For example, doping with solute elements to introduce point defect phonon scattering which leads to a value of κl=0.4Wm−1K−1 at 400 K and a zT ∼ 1.9 at 585 K in p-type AgSb0.96Zn0.04Te2 a in the work of Roychowdhury et al. []. Formation of second phases via solid-state precipitation is used to initiate phonon scattering at the resulting interfaces. For example, Sb2Te3 precipitates with sizes ranging from nanometer to micrometer led to a κl=0.65Wm−1K−1 at 300 K [,] in Ag16.7Sb30Te53.3 alloys. Introducing a high density of grain boundaries, i.e. reducing the grain size, enables also effective phonon scattering as proposed by Dresselhaus et al. []. In particular grain boundaries containing dislocations [], i. e. low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs), and dislocations within grains can significantly reduce κl as demonstrated by Chen et al. []. They reported on κl=0.4Wm−1K−1 resulting in a zT = 2.2 at 850 K in Na0.025Eu0.03Pb0.945Te TE alloys. Interfacial dislocations found in PbTe0.7S0.3 lead to =0.8Wm−1K−1 at room temperature [,].
