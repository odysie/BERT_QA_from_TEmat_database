a and b and are typical for doped and compensated semiconductors with high- and low-temperature activation regions . For LuNiSb the values of resistivity at 80 K is of the order of 24 μΩ m and with increasing temperature it decreases down to 18 μΩ m at room temperature indicating semiconductive type of conductivity. The GdNiSb compound is characterized by lower values of resistivity (8 μΩ m at 80 K), but tendency to decreasing of resistivity with increasing of temperature is clearly observed (3.9 μΩ m at 380 K). The Seebeck coefficient of the both studied compounds is characterized by positive values (70 µV/K, 12.8 µV/K at 380 K for LuNiSb and GdNiSb, respectively) indicating the dominance of p-type conductivity.
