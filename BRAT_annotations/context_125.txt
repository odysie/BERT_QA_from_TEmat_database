The dimensionless value ZT of Mg3-xAgxSb2 are calculated according to the formula ZT=α2T/ρκ, as shown in Figure (f), ZT values of doped Ag samples were significantly higher than that of undoped samples. With the increase of temperature and Ag content, the value of ZT gradually increases. A maximum ZT value of 0.66 was achieved in Mg2.96Ag0.04Sb2 at 773 K, which is higher than reported in the literature (0.51) [].
