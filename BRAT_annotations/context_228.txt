The power factor (σS2) is the highest for the film grown on M-plane sapphire reaching 45 μW m-1K-2 (500 °C), which is comparable to Xu et al. (60 μW m-1K-2) and Ohtaki et al. (50 μW m-1K-2) reported values on undoped CaMnO3 at room temperature. However, there are higher reported values from Kabir et al. (140 μW m-1K-2) and Zhu et al. (170 μW m-1K-2). The highest power factor for our films is the film on M-plane sapphire which is due to its low electrical resistivity.
