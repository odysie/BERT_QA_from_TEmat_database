Study on half-Heusler compounds RENiSb, RE = Sc, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Lu, was performed in perspective of high-temperature thermoelectric application. Relatively small electrical resistivity (4–60 μΩm in 300–1000 K) combined with fairly high positive Seebeck coefficient (40–160 μV/K) yielded for the RENiSb ternaries rather large thermoelectric power factors at 750 K, namely 14 μW K−2cm−1 for ScNiSb and 11 μW K−2cm−1 for TmNiSb. At room temperature the thermal conductivity measured for the two materials was 8.1 W K−1m−1 and 4.4 W K−1m−1, respectively. The value obtained for the latter compound is smaller than those reported for unoptimized half-Heusler phases based on d-electron elements. This finding may be explained by strong point defect scattering occurring due to intrinsic disorder in crystal structure of TmNiSb, or to smaller extent by enhanced scattering on incoherent grain boundaries with the impurity phases. Nevertheless, achieving good thermoelectric performance of the RENiSb phases at high temperatures requires proper tuning of carrier concentration, as well as further reduction in their thermal conductance by means of alloying and/or nanostructurization.
