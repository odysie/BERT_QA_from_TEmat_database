The LAMOX family of oxide conductors [], which is based on the parent compound La2Mo2O9, has an oxygen ion conductivity of ∼0.03 S/cm at 720 °C. A vacancy order–disorder phase transition, occurring at ∼580 °C from a monoclinic α form to a cubic β form results in the high anionic conductivity []. This phase transition leads to an abrupt volume expansion, which may be suppressed by a minor doping of La2Mo2O9. The maximum conductivity is reported for the compositions La1.7Bi0.3Mo2O9−δ, La2Mo1.7W0.3O9−δ, and La2Mo1.95V0.05O9−δ []. The stability in reducing atmosphere is an issue for these materials as La2Mo2O9 may loose about 1.14 of its 9 oxygen per unit formula. Substitution of lanthanum by other rare earths (Nd, Gd) increases the oxygen loss, thus, further investigation about appropriate doping should be pursued to improve stability and performance.
