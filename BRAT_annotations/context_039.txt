The Seebeck coefficient of GeTe increases with temperature, reaching a maximum of 89μV/K at 770 K; meanwhile, the thermopower of Ge0.9Sn0.1Te reaches a slightly lower maximum of 71μV/K at the same temperature. The unexpected drop in the Seebeck coefficient of the Sn-doped sample at ∼550 K coincides with the temperature of the rhombohedral to cubic phase transition. Nevertheless, this does not alter the temperature of the maximal Seebeck coefficient.
