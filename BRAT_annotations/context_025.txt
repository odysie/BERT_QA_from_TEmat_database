, the results from the Seebeck coefficient measurements are shown. a represents the Seebeck coefficients for the TiO2 nanotubes without Te–Bi–Pb nanoparticles, while b stands for the results of the TiO2 nanotube specimens with Te–Bi–Pb nanoparticles. The results evidently show that the TiO2 nanotubes with scattered Te–Bi–Pb nanoparticles have the Seebeck coefficient two times higher than that of the specimens without nanoparticles measuring in the temperature range from 30 °C to 200 °C. The highest Seebeck coefficient is 90 μV/K at 40 °C for pure TiO2 nanotubes. And for TiO2 nanotubes with Te–Bi–Pb nanoparticles, the highest Seebeck coefficient reaches 155 μV/K at 70 °C. The results show that the TiO2 nanotubes are n-type semiconductors. The Seebeck coefficients increase to peak values and then decrease for TiO2 nanotubes with or without nanoparticles. The lowest Seebeck coefficient is 17 μV/K at 200 °C for pure TiO2 nanotubes and 50 μV/K at 200 °C for TiO2 nanotubes with scattered Te–Bi–Pb nanoparticles which is nearly two times higher than that of the specimens without nanoparticles. This could be explained by quantum confinement effect. When the Te–Bi–Pb nanoparticles are small enough, the electrons and/or holes can be squeezed into a small domain approaching the Bohr radius. The energy spectrum turns to be discrete, leading to the size-dependent bandgap instead of continuous bandgap in a bulk material. This effect can result in different properties for nanostructured materials compared with conventional materials. Specifically, the bandgap is greater for nanoparticles than the corresponding bulk materials. As a result, the electron density is higher in the nanostructures of TiO2 nanotube supported Te–Bi–Pb nanoparticles. This might account for the result that the Seebeck coefficient of the TiO2 nanotubes with scattered Te–Bi–Pb nanoparticles is much higher than that of the pure TiO2 nanotubes.
