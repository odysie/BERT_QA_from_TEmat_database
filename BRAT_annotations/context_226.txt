CrSi2 has large electrical conductivity (σ = 1/ρ = 10^5 S/m) and Seebeck coefficient (S = 100 μV/K at 300 K) due to its large degeneracy near the band extrema coupled with anisotropy in the band mass. Because of its higher thermal conductivity value (κ = 10 W/m K), it has not been used in practical applications. The energy of covalent bonds analysis illustrates that the energy states closer to the Fermi level are from Cr d-states with some contribution from the Cr–Si hybridized levels. It indicates that both substitutions at Cr and Si sites can change the transport properties in CrSi2. Nishida et al. studied the substitution of Cr atom sites by Mn atom. They found that Mn atoms act as a donor and Cr1-xMnxSi2 solid solution changes from p- to n-type with increasing x. According to Pan et al., Al atoms on Cr sites act as an acceptor; thus, no conversion from p- into n-type semiconductor took place in Cr(Si1-xAlx)2 with increasing x. In connection with these facts, the purpose of the present report is to investigate the effect of co-substitution of Mn atoms on Cr sites and Al atoms on Si sites on the transport properties and ZT of Cr1-xMnxSi2-xAlx solid solution.
