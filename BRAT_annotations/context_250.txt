Here, we report the fabrication of Bi-doped Mg2Ge samples (Mg2Ge1-xBix, x = 0, 0.005, 0.010, 0.020, 0.030) as an alternative to Sb-doped Mg2Ge, via one-step spark plasma sintering of elemental Ge and Bi with MgH2. This method was previously used to avoid the long, high temperature traditional methods in the synthesis of Mg2Si, with the objective of reducing the volatilization and oxidation of Mg. The electronic transport properties are compared with those of an Sb-doped sample and previous reports on Sb-doped Mg2Ge samples fabricated by melting techniques followed by hot-pressing. A maximum zT of 0.32 at 750 K for Mg2Ge0.97Bi0.03 was obtained, which was higher than the previously reported zT value of 0.2 for Sb-doped Mg2Ge. This was achieved due to the lower thermal conductivity of this compound, originating from the bismuth-rich precipitates formed at the grain boundaries and embedded within the matrix. These results, however, suggest that there is very low solubility of Bi in Mg2Ge which limits its utility as an effective dopant.
