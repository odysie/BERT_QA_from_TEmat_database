a, indicating the typical electrical transport behavior of a degenerate semiconductor. Carrier concentration decreased with increasing In content because In filled Sn vacancies and excessive In atoms substituted Ge because of the solubility limit of GeTe. Consequently, p-type carrier concentration increased again. This phenomenon to similar to that observed in In-doped SnTe in a previous study. The Seebeck coefficients for Ge1-xInxTe (x
= 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04) compounds are presented in b. The Seebeck coefficients of all the samples were positive and showed p-type transport with holes dominating the free carrier concentration. All the doped samples had higher Seebeck coefficients than pure GeTe due to the distortion of DOS near the Fermi level; the room-temperature Seebeck coefficient of 1% In-doped GeTe sample is 59 μV/K, which is higher than that of the undoped GeTe sample (28 μV/K). However, Seebeck coefficient decreased at high doping content due to the solubility limit of GeTe and carrier concentration. The expanding band gap contributed to the improvement of the Seebeck coefficient at high temperatures and suppressed the bipolar effect. These findings were also obtained in a previous work. c shows the temperature dependence of the PF of Ge1-xInxTe (x
= 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04). PF increased from 31.5 μWcm−1
K−2 in pure GeTe to 39.5 μWcm−1
K−2 in Ge0.97In0.03Te at 773 K originating from the resonant states while In-doped GeTe has a higher carrier concentration. Meanwhile, the bipolar effect was suppressed.
