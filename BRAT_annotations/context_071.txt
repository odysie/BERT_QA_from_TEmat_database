As shown in c, the power factor of SnSe film deposited at a glancing angle shows the highest value of 18.5μWcm−1K−2 at 478 K. Compared to the film grown at normal angle, the power factor of the film deposited at glancing angle is enhanced significantly (>20 times higher). The enhancement of power factor is mainly contributed by the increase of Seebeck coefficient. The increment of Seebeck coefficient via the grain size control strategy can be explained by potential barrier scattering at grain boundaries. This concept has been investigated in theoretical and experimental ways, for bulk and thin film scales . Given a TE material with one type of mobile carrier, after a constant thermal gradient is applied onto the material, the carriers in the material will move from the hot side to the cold side by diffusion so as to induce the Seebeck voltage. Consequently, a potential difference will be developed on the both sides, drifting the mobile charge carrier back to the original position and diminishing the Seebeck voltage.
