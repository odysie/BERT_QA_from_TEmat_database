(a), and the variation trend of κtot with the increasing temperature is similar to that of electrical conductivity. Additionally, the total thermal conductivity was augmented obviously with increasing Sb amount. It is well known that κtot is the sum of the electronic (κele) and lattice thermal conductivity (κlat). The temperature dependence of the electronic thermal conductivity is depicted in (b), which elucidates that the total thermal conductivity increased largely with increasing Sb doping fractions due to the contribution from the electronic thermal conductivity. The κele is proportional to the electrical conductivity (σ) through the Wiedemann-Franz relation, κele = LσT, where L is the Lorenz number shown in (f) . An estimation of the Lorenz number can be made using a single parabolic band (SPB) model and assuming acoustic phonon scattering . Results show that the lattice thermal conductivities for heavily Sb-doped samples were reduced, especially at high temperature since the point defects caused by Sb doping intensified phonon scattering . The minimum lattice thermal conductivity can reach as low as ~ 0.58 Wm−1 K−1 at 623 K for Pb0.9825Sb0.0175Se, as shown in (c). One can see that the lattice thermal conductivity at room temperature was slightly increased with the rise of Sb content, which may result from the compensations of Pb vacancies . After optimizing carrier concentration via Sb doping, the maximum ZT of ~ 0.9 was achieved for Pb0.99Sb0.01Se at 873 K, as shown in (d).
