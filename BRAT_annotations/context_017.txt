Seebeck coefficient (S) measurement results are presented in b. S(T) data between 310 K and 700 K show p-type temperature dependence and Smax value of around incredible 190 μV/K. The room temperature value of S is ca. 40 μV/K and fits very well within the range deduced from previously reported data for isostructural phases. For instance, S298 for Yb14MgSb11, Yb14MnSb11, and its doped modifications, as well as A14MgBi11 phases (A = Sr, Eu, Yb) is in the range of 20–60 μV/K [,,,]; S298 for the series Ca13RECdSb11 (RE = La–Nd, Sm) is in the range of 30–70 μV/K []. The slight increase in value of S room temperature reported for Ca14MgSb11 (125 μV/K) is offset by the increased resistivity and most likely related to the oxidation of the surface of the measured material [].
