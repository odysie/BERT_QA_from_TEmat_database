Half Heusler (HH) alloys have attracted considerable interest as thermoelectric (TE) materials in the temperature range around 700 K and above, which is close to the temperature range of most industrial waste heat sources. HH compounds crystallize in the cubic MgAgAs structure-type, space group F3m, forming three interpenetrating face-centered cubic (fcc) sublattices and one vacant sublattice. In view of the Zintl mechanism, HH materials with 18 valence electrons were shown to exhibit semiconducting properties. A great advantage in the optimization of the thermoelectric properties of HH compounds is the possibility to individually dope each of these sublattices. The most attractive properties of HH materials for thermoelectrics are their high Seebeck coefficient S up to 300 μV K−1 at room temperature and their high electrical conductivity (100 to 1000 S cm−1); however, the drawback of HH alloys is their relatively high thermal conductivity reaching up to 10 W mK−1 at room temperature. Many HH compounds were investigated in the past with the aim to improve their thermoelectric properties. So far the highest ZT = 1.5 has been reported by Sakurada and Shutoh for Sb-doped n-type Ti0.5Zr0.25Hf0.25NiSn0.998Sb0.002 at 690 K and by Rogl et al. at a slightly higher temperature of 825 K. Schwall and Balke obtained ZT = 1.2 at 830 K via intrinsic phase separation in Ti0.5Zr0.25Hf0.25NiSn0.998Sb0.002. More recent attempts have succeeded in obtaining a ZT of ∼1.35 for n-type Ti0.15Zr0.25Hf0.65NiSn0.995Sb0.005 with nano-dispersed ZrO2 and for (Zr0.40Hf0.60)0.00V0.01NiSn0.998Sb0.002 with vanadium resonant states. For commercial thermoelectric applications, however, the high priced Hf-metal needs to be avoided. Therefore, it is interesting to note that for the Hf-free grades Ti0.5Zr0.5NiSn0.98Sb0.02 and Ti0.50Zr0.48Nb0.02NiSn0.98Sb0.02, a ZT = 1.2 was obtained with a thermoelectric efficiency η300–800 K > 11%. A significant progress was also made for p-type Nb1−xHfxFeSb with ZTmax ≈ 1.5 at 1200 K (ref. 15) and for the Hf free Ti-substituted solid solution Nb1−xTixFeSb. During our study of thermoelectric alloys in the section NbFeSb–TiFeSb, we noticed the absence of transport properties of the parent compound TiFeSb, which also served as the base for Fe/Co and Sb/Sn substituted thermoelectric materials. The Fe/Co substitution in TiFexCo1−xSb results in a significant increase of ZT from 0.05 for TiCoSb to 0.42 for TiFe0.3Co0.7Sb. These values are close to that reported for Sb/Sn substituted TiCoSb0.8Sn0.2 (ZTmax = 0.5 at 700 K (ref. 21)). In addition, a DFT calculation of Ti/Fe substitution in Ti1−xFexCoSb indicated a decrease of ZT from
