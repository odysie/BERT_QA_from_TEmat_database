A previous work, performed decades ago, suggested that PbS with a maximum ZT of only âˆ¼0.4 at 800 K is not a promising TE material . However, application of the aforementioned hierarchical concepts to PbS has demonstrated very substantial performance improvements; meanwhile, PbS has drawn renewed attention as a TE material due to its low-cost and reasonable properties for both n-type and p-type variants. a
