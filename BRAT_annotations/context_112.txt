Using soft chemistry method of synthesis with additional oxidation and reduction runs it was possible to obtain BaErMn2O5 and BaErMn2O6, yielding>95 wt% of the considered compounds. Structure of BaErMn2O5 is tetragonal (likely P4/nmm space group) at room temperature, while BaErMn2O6 exhibits either monoclinic P121 or triclinic P−1 symmetry. In situ XRD studies revealed complex behavior with the oxidation of BaErMn2O5 occurring at around 300 °C. BaErMn2O5-BaErMn2O6 system shows interesting oxygen storage-related properties, similar to the ones observed previously for BaYMn2O5–BaYMn2O6. The reversible oxygen storage capacity exceeds 3 wt%. Electrical properties of BaErMn2O5 indicate activated character of electrical conductivity on temperature, with Ea=0.30(1) eV in 50–500 °C range, with σ value at RT of the order of 10−4
S cm−1. Oxidized BaErMn2O6 possesses much higher electrical conductivity, almost 0.2 S cm−1 at room temperature. At about 225 °C structural and magnetic (from charge/orbital-ordered insulator COI(CE) to paramagnetic metal PM phase) phase transitions occur for this material, which can be associated with about tenfold increase of electrical conductivity. BaErMn2O6 possesses the highest conductivity of almost 40 S cm−1 near 500 °C. Seebeck coefficient is positive for BaYMn2O5 and negative for BaYMn2O6, indicating substantial changes in electronic structure, as caused by changing oxygen content.
