 shows the temperature dependence of the thermoelectric figure of merit. In general, the high-Cu-content samples have higher zT values. A maximum zT value of 1.34 at 773 K was achieved for both Ag1.2Cu0.8Te and AgCuTe. As shown in , the sample showed also good repeatability in thermoelectric transport properties. Ag1.2Cu0.8Te possessed particularly high zT values ranging from 0.78 at 523 K to 1.34 at 773 K, demonstrating the promising potential application of this material for heat harvesting.
