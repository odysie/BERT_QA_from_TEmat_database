 shows the ZT value calculated based on the electrical and thermal transport properties. The maximum ZT value is 1.22 at 350 °C for Zn0.915Na0.005Cd0.08Sb sample, which is greater than that of 0.99 for Zn0.995Na0.005Sb sample and 0.45 for ZnSb sample. The present ZT value of 1.22 is greater than that of other ZnSb based thermoelectric materials . The improved ZT value can be attributed to the enhanced power factor caused by the enhanced electrical conductivity, as shown in , and the reduced thermal conductivity, as shown in . In addition, the average ZT value is improved from 0.7 of the Zn0.995Na0.005Sb sample to 0.912 of the Zn0.915Na0.005Cd0.08Sb sample due to the Cd substitution.
