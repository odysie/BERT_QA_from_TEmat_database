The first typical example is the Seebeck coefficient enhancement in PbTe by the density-of-states (DOS) distortion through Tl doping . Such a situation can occur when the valence or conduction band of the host semiconductor resonates with the localized impurity energy level. Compared with Na doped PbTe with the same carrier concentration, Tl doped PbTe shows increased effective mass and pronuanced higher Seebeck coefficient. The DOS distortion results in a ZT as high as 1.5 at 773Â K, which is very impressive by merely introducing Tl elements in PbTe. The conjunction of this new physical principle with the approaches used to lower the thermal conductivity could further enhance ZT in PbTe system, and have been proved equally applicable in other thermoelectric systems, such as Al-dopd PbSe, such as Al-dopd PbSe and In-doped SnTe systems.
