The dimensionless figure of merit ZT values as a function of temperature for these samples along both directions are shown in Fig. 5. The highest ZT of 0.025 is obtained at 723 K along the // direction for SnSe:Bi 6% sample, which seems to be the optimal doping content. Due to the small electrical conductivity, the total thermal conductivity is mostly attributed to the lattice thermal conductivity. Therefore, lower thermal conductivity is obtained along the // direction owing to the weak atomic connections. Consequently, higher ZT values are obtained along the // direction. However, these ZT values are quite small compared to those of single crystal or even other polycrystalline SnSe due to the lower S and Ïƒ values.
