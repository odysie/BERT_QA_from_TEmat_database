To demonstrate the high thermoelectric performance of the ZrCoBi-based half-Heuslers, comparison of the temperature-dependent ZT between ZrCoBi0.65Sb0.15Sn0.20 and the state-of-the-art p-type half-Heuslers (e.g., HfCoSb-baseds, ZrCoSb-based, and NbFeSb-based half-Heuslers)â€“ is shown in Fig. 1a. Clearly, ZrCoBi0.65Sb0.15Sn0.20 outperforms all the other p-type half-Heuslers in the whole temperature range and a record-high peak ZT of ~1.42 at 973 K can be achieved. The average ZT is further calculated by the integration method in the temperature of 300 to 973 K, where ZrCoBi0.65Sb0.15Sn0.20 demonstrates the highest average ZT of ~0.81, and it is only ~0.69 for Nb0.88Hf0.12FeSb, ~0.57 for Nb0.8Ti0.2FeSb, ~0.54 for Hf0.44Zr0.44Ti0.12Sb0.8Sn0.2, and ~0.53 for Hf0.8Ti0.2CoSb0.8Sn0.2.
