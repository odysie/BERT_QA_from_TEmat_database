In this work, we synthesized high-purity Cu4Sn7S16-based compounds and studied their electrical and thermal transports as well as the doping effects. Using Sb and Ag as dopants, the carrier concentration was tuned from 2.1 × 10^17 cm−3 to 6.7 × 10^18 cm−3. The electrical transport properties can be reasonably described by the single parabolic band model. When compared with CuFeS2, the compound Cu4Sn7S16 was found to have a higher mobility due to the absence of d electrons from Fe and a lower thermal conductivity benefiting from the complex crystal structure. A maximum zT = 0.27 was achieved at 700 K in Ag-doped Cu4Sn7S16.
