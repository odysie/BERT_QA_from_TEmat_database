(c) shows the Seebeck coefficient, S, plotted against temperature for the same sample. S increased almost linearly with decreasing temperature down to about 170 K, reached a maximum at about 130 K and dropped to zero at about 100 K. The observed temperature dependence is a characteristic of the in-plane TEP for optimally doped HTSC . On the other hand, both the absolute value and the temperature dependence of S differ greatly from those for optimally doped La-214. For example, S at 290 K is 40 Î¼V/K in La1.85Sr0.15CuO4. Accordingly it is likely that the anomalous behavior of TEP in La-214 is not due to its structure with a single CuO2 layers but due to a phenomenon specific to La-214 such as the stripe order of spin and charge .
