Heusler-type alloy is a kind of intermetallic compounds with a formula of X2YZ, where X and Y are transition metals and Z is the III or IV element in the periodic table. Among these compounds, Fe2VAl has attracted intense attention because there is a deep, well-developed pseudogap about 0.1–0.2 eV near the Fermi level, which is highly unusual for intermetallic compounds . This characteristic makes Fe2VAl show semiconductor-like behavior in electrical transport . In recent years, Fe2VAl-based alloys have been investigated widely as a promising thermoelectric compound because semiconductors with a narrow band-gap are inclined to have good thermoelectric performance . Investigations on the low temperature transport between 10 and 300 K of Fe2−xV1+xAl (0 ≤
x
≤ 0.11) revealed that the thermoelectric property is greatly affected by Fe and V contents . The Seebeck coefficient of Fe2VAl at room temperature is about 40 V/K. When Fe was replaced by V, the conduction shifted from p-type to n-type, while the Seebeck coefficient and low-temperature electrical conductivity increased sharply . Other research showed that the Seebeck coefficient of Fe2VAl was also sensitive to Al content . The Seebeck coefficient shifted from −130 to 75 V/K with the deviation of the Al content in (Fe2/3V1/3)100−yAly (23.8 ≤
y
≤ 25.8) alloys . Besides, the effects of Ge substitution and Si substitution for Al site were also reported by Nishino et al. and Lue et al. , respectively. The Fe2VAl1−xGex (0 ≤

≤ 0.20) and Fe2VAl1−xSix (0 ≤
x
≤ 0.50) alloys were synthesized by arc-melting and the results showed that Ge or Si substituting for Al site could dramatically enhance the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity, leading to a rather large power factor at room temperature. Recently, the Fe2VAl alloy with fine microstructure was synthesized by mechanical alloying and pulse-current sintering, exhibiting an improved ZT value . Furthermore, the thermoelectric properties of (Fe1−xCox)2TiAl and p-type (Fe2−xCox)(V1−yTiy)Al alloys were also studied, which showed that the Co is a promising substituting element for Fe2VAl system . However, the systematical effect of Co substitution for Fe2VAl remains a key issue for the thermoelectric property of Fe2VAl. For Fe2VAl-based alloys, tuning the electrical transport is a key approach to improve the thermoelectric property and it is also crucial to further reduce the thermal conductivity in order to achieve higher ZT value.
