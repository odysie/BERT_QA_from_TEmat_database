Filled skutterudites can have low thermal conductivity like a glass and high electrical conductivity like a crystal, which make them excellent thermoelectric materials according to the “phonon glass electron crystal” (PGEC) concept . Among various kinds of filled skutterudite materials, Yb-doped skutterudites have shown good thermoelectric properties due to the heavy mass and small radius of the Yb atom compared to other fillers, and have been selected by many automotive companies, such as General Motors, as the most promising thermoelectric material for waste heat recovery . Nolas et al. first reported a zT value of 1.0 for Yb0.19Co4Sb12 at 600 K . Composites containing Yb-filled CoSb3 and well-distributed Yb2O3 particles were synthesized by Zhao et al. with zT of 1.3 for Yb0.25Co4Sb12/Yb2O3 at 850 K . Later zT of 1.3 for Yb0.285Co4Sb12.268 at 800 K was reported by Li et al. .
