. Moreover, the thermoelectric properties of Ga0.2Co4Sb12.3-xTex (x = 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1) are shown in . The ZT values at temperatures lower than 675 K almost not change with the increase of Te content. But when the temperature is higher than 675 K, the ZT value increases with increasing Te content due to the enhancement of the suppressed bipolar effect. (a) shows the temperature-dependent electrical conductivity of GaxCo4Sb12.3 (x = 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25). The electrical conductivity of GaxCo4Sb12.3 samples rises rapidly with temperature until it reaches the extreme value (e.g. 286.69 S cm−1 at 473 K for Ga0.2Co4Sb12.3), then tends to be flat, and rises again when the temperature is higher than 600 K, which is characterized by intrinsic excitation. As Ga contents increase, the electrical conductivity increases until the filling fraction (x) of Ga increases to 0.2, indicating that Ga filling is almost saturated at x = 0.2. With some Te doping, the electrical conductivity improves significantly, which increases from 208 S cm−1 for Ga0.2Co4Sb12.3 to 1281 S cm−1 for Ga0.2Co4Sb11.3Te at room temperature ((b)). The excellent electrical performance of Ga0.2Co4Sb11.3Te comes from the substitution of a portion of Sb atoms by Te atoms with more outer electrons, which enhances the carrier concentration largely. The enhanced carrier concentration is also proved by room-temperature Hall effect measurements of Ga0.2Co4Sb12.3 and Ga0.2Co4Sb11.3Te samples, as shown in
