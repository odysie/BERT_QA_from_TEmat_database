In conclusion, polycrystalline SnSe has been doped with various Bi concentrations by hot-press method (Additional file). The samples exhibited the layered structure with a preferential (h00) orientation. An anisotropic transport and thermoelectric properties have been observed. The electrical conductivities perpendicular to the pressing direction (12.85 S cm-1) are higher than those parallel to the pressing direction (6.46 S cm-1) at 773 K for SnSe:Bi 8% sample, while thermal conductivities perpendicular to the pressing direction (0.81 W m- 1 K-1) are higher than those parallel to the pressing direction (0.60 W m-1 K-1) at 773 K for SnSe:Bi 8% sample. We observed a bipolar conducting mechanism in our samples leading to n- to p-type transition, whose temperature increases with Bi concentration. The optimum Bi doping concentration was 6% with the highest ZT value of 0.025 at 723 K. This ZT value is quite low due to the low electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient. Our work addressed a possibility to dope polycrystalline SnSe by a hot-pressing process, which may be applied to module applications.
