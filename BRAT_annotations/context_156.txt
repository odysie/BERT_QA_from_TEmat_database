The structural, electronic and thermal transport properties of AA-stacked SnSe bilayer are investigated using the DFT combined with Boltzmann transport theory. AA-stacked SnSe bilayer is an indirect band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 0.88 eV. It has significant anisotropy in its properties along armchair and zigzag directions. It has low lattice thermal conductivity in comparison to other two-dimensional materials like MoS2, graphene and phosphorene etc. The thermoelectric performance of n-type SnSe bilayer is better as compared to that of p-type SnSe bilayer structure. The peak values of zT for n-type SnSe bilayer are 0.72, 0.55, 0.33 along the zigzag direction and 0.78, 0.64, 0.42 along the armchair direction at 800 K, 500 K, 300 K, respectively. Thus bilayer SnSe is a promising thermoelectric material that could be used in nanoscale thermoelectric devices such as thermocouples, thermoelectric generators etc. We also expect that the advent of nanotechnology will make it easier to use the nanostructured SnSe in thermoelectric devices for practical applications.
