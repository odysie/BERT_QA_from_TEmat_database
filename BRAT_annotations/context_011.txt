The Se-alloying induced changes in structural transition, band structure and TE properties of zone melted Sb2Te3-xSex alloys are systematically investigated by both experiments and theoretical calculations. The structural transition from rhombohedral phase to mixed structure phases appears at x = 2.0. The bandgap at room temperature of Sb2Te3-xSex (x = 1.5–2.4) decreases with increasing Se contents x. Ag doping is further applied to optimize the carrier concentration of Sb2TeSe2 matrix. Consequently, the zT is further improved and shifted to higher temperature, and the maximum zT value of ∼0.4 is achieved at 680 K for Sb1.97Ag0.03TeSe2.
