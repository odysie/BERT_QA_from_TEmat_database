Here, we tackle this problem, by successfully achieving the hard task of measuring the longest ever reported lifetimes for acoustic phonons in a large single crystal of the clathrate Ba7.81Ge40.67Au5.33 (about 54 atoms in the unit cell) whose measured lattice thermal conductivity at 300 K is of 1.1 W m-1 K-1 (see Methods and Supplementary Note). This result has been possible thanks to the remarkable crystalline quality (bulk mosaicity of 0.01Â°, see Methods and Supplementary Note) achieved, allowing for unprecedented high-resolution measurements of the acoustic phonon lifetime by means of INS and NRSE. These measurements are supported by ab initio density functional theory (DFT) simulations, and allow us to experimentally confirmed of the long-established thermal transport modeling in complex systems.
