This study presented a simple method to fabricate the Bi2Te3 TE fibers with oriented nanosheet microstructure and outstanding electrical transportation. Rational tensile stress and annealing treatment can significantly enhance the power factor of the high-performance Bi2Te3 TE fibers. The resulting undoped Bi2Te3 cores exhibit a power factor of 1.32 mW m−1 K−2 and a ZT of ∼0.76 at 300 K. And the TE fiber cup generator covered with Bi2Te3 TE fibers reaches a power of 0.47 μW under ΔT = 19 K. Tensile stress tuning from the physical mechanism of thermal size reduction can be an effective tool for the layered chalcogenide materials optimization at band structures and thermoelectric properties.
