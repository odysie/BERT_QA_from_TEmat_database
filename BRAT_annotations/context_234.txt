We discuss La3Cu3P4 and La3Cu3As4200 μV/K) is obtained even at quite low temperatures (300 K) with doping concentration up to 5 × 10^19 cm-3. At 1000 K for both La3Cu3P4 and La3Cu3As4 thermopowers in the range of 180–300 μV/K are found for hole concentrations between 6 × 10^19 cm-3 to 2 × 10^20 cm-3. Due to the substantial bandgap of La3Cu3P4 and La3Cu3As4, there are no bipolar effects and therefore thermopower keeps on increasing with temperature even at low doping concentrations. Due to the higher effective masses (presented in Table 1) the thermopower for p-type doping is nearly 1.5 times higher than that of n-type doping. Thermopower under n-type doping is presented in the Supplementary Information Fig. S4. Next we discuss thermopower for La3Cu3Sb4 and La3Cu3Bi4. With a calculated bandgap of 0.24 and 0.33 eV for Bi and Sb compound we expect significant bipolar conduction at high temperatures. The experimental measurements for hole doped thermopower of La3Cu3Sb4 were carried out by Fess et al. Their measured 300 K thermopower of ~60 μV/K at hole doping of 5.1 × 10^20 cm-3 agrees well with our calculated value of 55 μV/K. As shown in Fig. 4(b) we find that 1000 K hole doped thermopower barely exceeds 200 μV/K. The n-type thermopower does not even exceed -180 μV/K (shown in Supplementry Information Fig. S4.), indicating poor thermoelectric performance under n-type doping.
