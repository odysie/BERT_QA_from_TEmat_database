 shows the temperature dependent S, ρ, and S2/ρ for CoSb2.85-yTe0.15Sey. The Seebeck coefficient (a) of all samples is negative over the measured temperature range in agreement with the Hall measurement that shows electron-dominated transport. The absolute value of S increases with increasing temperature. The magnitude of S increases dramatically with increasing y from 0.025 to 0.05, and decreases with higher y of 0.1. Such a variation is in consistent with the change of carrier concentration n (), the values of which are −4.34 × 10^20 cm-3, -3.11 × 10^20 cm-3, and -3.45 × 10^20 cm-3 for y = 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1, respectively. S reaches the highest value of 238 μV/K at 760 K for CoSb2.8Te0.15Se0.05. The two y = 0.05 samples show nearly identical S over the measured temperature range. All samples show a positive temperature dependence of ρ (b), indicating a typical behavior of heavily doped semiconductors. ρ of the samples where y = 0.025 and 0.05 are close and much lower than y = 0.1, which is attributed to the combining effect of carrier concentration and mobility (). The power factor (c) of the sample where y = 0.05 is significantly enhanced because of the highest Seebeck coefficient and the lowest electrical resistivity achieved. The highest value of 4.34 mW m-1 K−2 is obtained at 760 K for CoSb2.8Te0.15Se0.05. S, ρ, and S2/ρ versus Se concentration (y) are shown in d. The optimized composition achieves the best electrical transport properties.
