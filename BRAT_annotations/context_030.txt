Similar to NaxCoO2, the addition of Ag as a dopant or a second phase composite has been shown to improve TE properties of Ca3Co4O9. A Ca2.7Ag0.3Co4O9/Ag-10 wt% composite showed an enhanced ZT of 0.5 at 1000 K. Bismuth (Bi) doping has also resulted in enhanced TPFs and reduced κ. However, the ZT of Bi-doped samples, is not as high as those of Ag doped oxides. Ca2.75Gd0.25Co4O9 ceramics have also been shown to exhibit TPF and ZT of 480 μW/m K2 and 0.23 respectively, at 923 K (c) . It is seen that the Ca2.75Gd0.25Co4O9 ceramics synthesised using the SPS method exhibit slightly higher TPFs and ZTs compared to hot press (HP) synthesised samples (c). There are also reports on the doping of Ca3Co4O9 with transition metals such as copper and nickel. Gallium addition has been demonstrated to improve TPFs and ZTs . Doping with lanthanum and lanthanide elements has also been studied but the TE enhancements have not been as impressive .
