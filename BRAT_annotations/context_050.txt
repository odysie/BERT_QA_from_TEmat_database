High zT of ~2.0 can also be achieved even in such a larg f42 mm 18 mm) bulk sample. These results highlight the mu quarternary alloying with Mg and Se, and demonstrate the realiua. Quarternary alloys of Pb1exMgxTe0.8Se0.2 were designed to i merit zT. A maximum zT of ~2.2 at 820 K was achieved in chalcogenides, which are described using a building block approach, and of the potential of these materials for thermoelectric applications. This review provides an overview of the structural chemistry of layered oxy-through the utilization of a rational pseudocubic structure that results into cubic-like degenerate electronic bands. Based on the concept of conductive network, we propose the optimization scheme for both electrical and thermal transport properties in caged filled skutterudites and caged-free Cu-based diamond-like compounds. Through the high throughput screening method, several promising half-Heusler compositions with high power factors are proposed out of a large composition collection. At last, we enhance electricalnetwork, dimensionality reduction by quantum effects, and high throughput material and Boltzmann transport theory, a new strategy is introduced to design high-perform. The lowest lattice thermal conductivity that was produced in the 2 mol% Na doped (PbTe)0.88(PbS)0.12Na0.02 material was elucidated by the micro structural analysis and confirmed by the Callaway's model. It has come to concluded that the larger precipitate
