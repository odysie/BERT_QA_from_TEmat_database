Although Ag2Se materials with excellent TE performance at room temperature have been reported, they are all non-flexible. In this work, we developed a facile strategy to prepare n-type flexible Ag2Se film on a nylon membrane. The Ag2Se film showed a very high power factor of 987.4 μWm-1K-2 at 300 K, which is one of the best values reported for flexible n-type materials and even comparable to that of some high-ZT inorganic bulk materials at high temperatures, such as SnSe (~900 μWm-1K-2 at 773 K) and Cu2-xSe (1200 μWm-1K-2 at 1000 K).
