Zinc oxide and its compounds become promising candidates for operation in high-temperature conditions. This is attributed to its excellent chemical and thermal stability at high temperatures, as well as superior electrical properties through elemental doping, nontoxic components and abundant natural resources. However, when phonons develop from the lattice vibrations and transport through the material, an orderly structure with insufficient defects results in a large mean phonon path lph, further restraining the intrinsic scattering mechanism. As we see in Figure 1a, different such as PGEC (phonon glass - electron crystal) materials characterised by very complex crystal structures and heavy atom compaction, the simple wurtzite structure of ZnO contains only two light elements and leads to less atom mass. Even if it has covalent properties—the electronegativities of Zn and O are 1.65 and 3.44, respectively—ionic bonds still dominate the whole material. Due to the strong interaction of ionic bonds and covalent bonds, phonons can transport between the crystal lattice with mostly harmonic vibration, and therefore the thermal conductivity of ZnO remains high during scattering processes with κL over 40 W m-1 K-1 at room temperature, as Keyes mentioned. When the crystal structure changes from wurtzite binary ZnO to perovskite ternary compound CaMnO3, the ABO3 structure (Figure 1b) was more complex and multi-octahedral or tetrahedral intervals made spaces for other elements, even doping locations could increase to three, and the TE properties of CaMnO3 substituted at A and/or B sites have been widely investigated—they have been found to depend on their preferable electrical performance. Furthermore, complex crystal structure made the intrinsic thermal conductivity of CaMnO3 reduce to only 3.6 W m-1 K-1 at room temperature when compared with ZnO, and, similar to ZnO, CaMnO3 has strong covalent or ionic bonds of Mn–O, O–O and Ca–O; lack of weak linkages between atoms would limit the further decrease of κL value.
