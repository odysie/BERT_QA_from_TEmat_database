Similar results were previously obtained for the single substitution of Mn on Cr sites and Al on Si sites, but with a weak impact on the dimensionless figure of merit ZT up to 450 K. Figure 7 shows the ZT values as a function of composition and temperature up to 773 K. The Cr1-xMnxSi2-xAlx alloys exhibit higher ZT values than pure CrSi2 over the entire temperature range, and ZT increases with Mn and Al contents. At 300 K, ZT = 0.020 and 0.025 for CrSi2 and Cr0.90Mn0.10Si1.90Al0.10, respectively. The maximum value of ZT = 0.095 was observed at 625 K for x = 0 and ZT = 0.13 at 625 K for x = 0.10. The TE efficiency of CrSi2 is significantly increased with both Mn and Al substitution.
