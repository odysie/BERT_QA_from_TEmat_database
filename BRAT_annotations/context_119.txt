Other important members in the family of fluorite-based oxide ion electrolytes are doped CeO2 and the intrinsic oxide ion conductor δ-Bi2O3, both of which in fact have higher conductivities than YSZ especially at temperatures lower than 800 °C. Indeed, δ-Bi2O3 exhibits the highest ionic conductivity of >1 S/cm at 800 °C, but is only stable in a narrow temperature regime between 730 °C and its melting temperature of 804 °C. This stability regime can be extended to lower temperatures by extrinsic doping of the Bi-sublattice typically by Y2O3 or Er2O3, although usually at the expense of lower conductivity. Electrolytes based on these doped oxides have been considered for low temperature SOFC applications but their major shortcoming is their chemical instability in the reducing environment at the anode side of the SOFC. This usually leads to onset of p-type electronic conduction in the case of doped-ceria due to the reduction of Ce+4 to Ce+3 thus reducing the useful cell voltage, and, in the case of doped-Bi2O3, possible shorting or failure of the cell by the reduction of Bi2O3 to metallic Bi or by volatilization . However, in many cases, this shortcoming can be circumvented by the use of bi-layer electrolyte architecture. Indeed, thin film YSZ interlayers deposited on the anode faces of the doped-CeO2 or -Bi2O3 electrolytes physically isolate the electrolyte from the reducing gas environment and helps prevent electrolyte stability problems associated with the effect of reduction reactions .
