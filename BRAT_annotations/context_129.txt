Yb14MnSb11 has a body-centered, I41/acd crystal structure, as shown in (a). The green and purple spheres represent Yb and Sb, respectively, and the filled red polyhedron indicates MnSb4 tetrahedron . The molecular weight of Yb14MnSb11 is 3783.088, which is more than ten times higher than that of PbTe (334.8). The electrical resistivity ((b)) increases linearly with temperature and reaches ∼5.4 × 10−3 Ω·cm at 1200 K. The high electrical resistivity corresponds to a low mobility of about 3 cm2/Vs that decreases with temperature. The Seebeck coefficient for Yb14MnSb11 ((c)) reveals a monotonic increase with temperature and reaches a maximum of +185 μV/K at 1275 K. The resulting power factor calculated from the electronic properties exhibits a maximum of ∼6.0 μW/cmK2 at 1200 K, as shown in (d). This value is somewhat low compared with the-state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials . As shown in (e), the thermal conductivity of Yb14MnSb11 is very low, ranging from ∼ 0.7 to 0.9 W/mK from 300 to 1275 K. The low thermal conductivity value is even comparable to a glass, largely owing to the complexity (limiting the phonon mean-free path) and heavy atomic mass (reducing the fraction of atomic vibrational modes that carry heat efficiently) of the crystal. Overall, the ZT for Yb14MnSb11 ((f)) sharply increases with temperature and reaches a maximum of ∼1.0 at 1223 K. Considering the low power factor of Yb14MnSb11, further improvement of the ZT should be possible through carrier concentration optimization .
