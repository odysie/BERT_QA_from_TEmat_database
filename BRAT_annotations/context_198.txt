Abstract:
p-Type Ce1-zPrzFe4-xCoxSb12 skutterudites were prepared by encapsulated melting, quenching, annealing, and hot pressing. While the skutterudite phase was successfully synthesized, a small amount of the secondary phase (FeSb2) was observed. According to the scanning electron microscope analysis, (Ce,Pr)Sb2 phases were also observed for Co-substituted specimens (x = 0.5). The electrical conductivity decreased with increasing temperature, implying a degenerate semiconductor behavior, and also decreased with increasing Co contents. All specimens showed p-type characteristics having positive signs of the Hall coefficient and the Seebeck coefficient. The Seebeck coefficient increased with increasing temperature and reached a maximum value at 823 K. The power factor (PF) increased with decreasing Co content and Ce0.75Pr0.25	Fe4Sb12 showed a peak value of PF = 3.2 mW m-1 K-2 at 823 K. The electronic thermal conductivity decreased with increasing Co contents and the lattice thermal conductivity decreased with decreasing Ce and Co contents at high temperature. The thermal conductivity increased at temperatures above 623 K due to bipolar conduction. The dimensionless figure‚ê£of merit (ZT) showed a maximum value of ZT = 0.84 at 823 K for Ce0.25Pr0.75Fe4Sb12.
