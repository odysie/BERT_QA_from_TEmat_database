Figure 6 shows the calculated zT values for all the Yb, Ga-CCCD skutterudites. The zT value is enhanced at higher Yb content and the highest zT reaches 1.25 at 780 K in the sample Yb0.35Ga0.15, comparable to the best performing Yb single filled skutterudites. The inset of Fig. 6 shows the zT value greatly enhanced by introducing Ga-CCCD with the same Yb filling fraction. The thermoelectric performance improvement is mainly attributed to its unique electronic band structure as well as mixed phonon scattering mechanism produced by Ga-CCCD. The thermoelectric performance of Ga-containing CCCD materials can be optimized by adjusting filling fraction of the secondary filler atoms, like Yb in this study.
