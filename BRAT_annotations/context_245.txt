Figure 6a shows the total thermal conductivity of PbxSb1-xCrSe3 as a function of temperature. The total thermal conductivity κ can be divided into contributions from the lattice κL and charge carrier κe, which are referred to as the electrical thermal conductivity. Assuming a constant Lorenz number L=2.45 × 10^-8 V2 K-2, κe can be estimated by the Wiedemann–Franz law (κe=LσT). Consequently, κL can be readily obtained by subtracting κe from κ. In both doped and undoped PbxSb1-xCrSe3, κe is small (<0.08 W m-1 K-1) (Figure 6b) because of the relatively low electrical conductivity. In Figure 6c, owing to Umklapp scattering, κL decreased with increasing temperature up to ~800 K, at which point the bipolar contribution was noticeable. The thermal diffusivity λ showed a negative temperature dependence below 800 K, whereas above this temperature intrinsic excitations dominated. The SbCrSe3 compound exhibited low lattice thermal conductivities of 1.08 W m-1 K-1 at 300 K and 0.56 W m-1 K-1 at 900 K, which are lower than those of the other PbTe-based materials.Figure 6d displays the ZT values of PbxSb1-xCrSe3. The peak ZT of undoped SbCrSe3 was 0.018 at 800 K. The doped samples exhibited much higher ZTs and the peak value was shifted towards higher temperatures. The largest ZT=0.46 was achieved at 900 K in Pb0.05Sb0.95CrSe3. This value is 24 times larger than the figure of merit of pristine SbCrSe3. Such increased ZT values in the doped compounds were attributed to cooperatively acting large enhancements in the electrical conductivity and the decreased lattice thermal conductivity upon Pb doping.
