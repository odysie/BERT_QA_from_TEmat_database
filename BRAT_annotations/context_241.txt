The results from electrical conductivity measurements show that Ïƒ changes with variation of the indium content of the skutterudite material. However, the highest electrical conductivity is obtained for the In0.2Co4Sb12qu sample with 1200 S cm-1 at about 350 K and descends as a function of temperature, indicating a heavily doped semiconductor system. The sample In0.2Co4Sb12 shows similar temperature characteristics at a lower absolute value starting at 950 S cm-1 at about 350 K, whereas the sample with x = 0.05 displays a relatively low electrical conductivity and characteristics of beginning intrinsic semiconductor behavior at about 550 K, where the electrical conductivity of the sample increases again because of the bipolar conduction. This is compliant with the results on the thermal conductivity data.
