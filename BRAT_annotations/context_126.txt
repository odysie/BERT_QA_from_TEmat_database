In summary, we have studied the structural, elastic, electronic and thermoelectric properties of Sr3MN (M = Sb, Bi) under pressure using density functional. The Pugh's ratio and the Cauchy pressure of both compounds increase with the pressure and brittle to ductile transition occurs at 15 GPa. Both compounds shows semiconducting band structures and our calculated bandgaps by using TB-mBJ potential are in reasonable agreement with experimental and available theoretical values. The density of states increases slightly at the Fermi level with pressure. The Seebeck coefficient at 15 GPa and 600 K in TB-mBJ+SOC calculation for Sr3SbN and Sr3BiN are 257 and 142 μV/K and the corresponding lattice thermal conductivities are 0.11 and 0.06 W/mK, respectively. The lattice thermal conductivity of both compounds decreases with pressure and the predicted figure of merit (ZT) for Sr3SbN and Sr3BiN at 600 K and 15 GPa, are 0.71 and 0.22, respectively. The ZT values for Sr3BiN decreases with temperature and at 300 K it is 0.63. Therefore, both compounds are suitable for thermoelectric device applications due to their ductile nature and high Seebeck coefficient. The calculated power factor (16.5 μWcm−1K−2) for Sr3SbN at 600 K is higher than the value of 10.1μWcm−1K−2 of SnSe single crystals []. The further improvement of thermoelectric performance of the studied materials can be achieved by doping, alloying or nano-structuring. We hope that the predicted results will inspire experimentalist to synthesis these materials at high pressure to realize the possibility in thermoelectric device applications.
