Polymer-nanowire/nanorod-based composites have advantageous mechanical flexibility due to their high aspect ratios compared with those of polymer-nanoparticle composites. Segalman etÂ al. reported that PEODT-BiTe3 nanorod composites showed a high ZT of 0.1 at room temperature. The high ZT value is due to the low thermal conductivity of 0.2 W/m-K for the composite, which was thought to be caused by phonon scattering by the nanowires/nanorods. The relationship between the length of the nanostructures and TE performance was further investigated, but it remains unclear because an increase in the nanowire length is always accompanied by an increase in the diameter. The diameter of the nanostructures may considerably alter the TE properties, so further investigation is needed to understand the size-property relationship of the composites (
