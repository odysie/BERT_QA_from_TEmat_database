The plot of the variation of Power factor (S2σ) experienced steady increase with the corresponding increase in temperature for both Ca3PbO and Ca3SnO as shown in (b). The power factor is an important in characterizing the thermoelectric potential as it appears in numerator of ZT and independent of total thermal conductivity. The power factor can be further enhanced without considering the effect of total thermal conductivity. At 290 K, the value of power factor for Ca3SnO is 160 μWm−1 K−2 while for Ca3PbO is 94 μWm−1 K−2. The greater value of power for Ca3SnO over the whole range of temperature, reveals Ca3SnO to be better thermoelectric material than Ca3PbO over the wide range of temperature which is compatible to experimental results [].
