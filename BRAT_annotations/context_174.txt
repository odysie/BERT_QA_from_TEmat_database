The temperature-dependent total thermal conductivity κ is demonstrated in Fig. 5a. At room temperature, when the Pb doping content x is less than 0.08, the thermal conductivity of the out-of-plane direction for Bi2Te3Pbx is comparable to that of the undoped Bi2Te3. However, a different effect was found with increasing temperature. For the undoped Bi2Te3, the thermal conductivity rapidly and monotonously increases when the temperature is above 323 K. However, the thermal conductivity of Bi2Te3Pbx first decreases monotonously and then slowly increases at elevated temperature. In addition, the higher the content of Pb doping, the slower the increase. The thermal conductivity for Bi2Te3Pbx decreased remarkably after Pb doping compared with the undoped Bi2Te3 at elevated temperature, especially when the dopant content x equals to 0.08. For the undoped Bi2Te3, the κ increases from the minimum value of 1.28 W m- 1 K- 1 at 300 K to 2.09 W m- 1 K- 1 at 503 K. The κ of the Pb0.08 sample reaches the minimum value of 0.87 W m- 1 K- 1 at 423 K and only increases to 0.96 W m- 1 K- 1 at 503 K. The κ of the Pb0.08 sample has been reduced by about 54% compared with the undoped Bi2Te3 at 503 K.
