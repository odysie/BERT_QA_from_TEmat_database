. As can be seen from , the Seebeck coefficients of both the samples are positive which imply that they are p-type semiconductors. With increasing temperature, the Seebeck coefficient firstly increases and then decreases after about 580 K, which is consistent with the result of Zeming . In addition, the Seebeck coefficient of Fe0.6Co3.4Sb12 is higher than that of CoSb3, which is possibly due to the decreasing carrier concentration by Fe substituting for Co. Especially, the maximal Seebeck coefficient 148.77 μV/K was obtained for Fe0.6Co3.4Sb12 at about 550 K, which is higher than the result of Soon-Chul Ur (∼80 μV/K) .
