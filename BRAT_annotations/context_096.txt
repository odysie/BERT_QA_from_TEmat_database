PbTe-based materials still remain the top-performing thermoelectric materials in the temperature range of 600–900 K. Na is recognized as an effective p-type dopant in PbTe, resulting in a hole concentration in the range of 10^18 to 10^20 cm−3 at room temperature. Recently, a high ZT of ∼1.4 was achieved in heavily doped PbTe with Na content close to 2%. At high doping levels, the transport properties of PbTe are dominated by holes with high effective mass as a result of the broadening of the Fermi distribution. This is particularly effective at high temperature when the light and heavy valence bands converge. Based on a modeling study that considered the above-mentioned band features, the optimum ZT of heavily doped p-type PbTe is ∼1.7 at 750 K. Here we confirm this assertion experimentally by doping PbTe with large amounts of Na (4%), resulting in the highest known ZT for non-nanostructured p-type PbTe (∼1.7 at 810 K).
