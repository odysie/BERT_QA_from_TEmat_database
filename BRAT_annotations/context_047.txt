(d) shows the temperature-dependent κ of the pristine BST, annealed BST, 0.22wt.%Cu/BST, and annealed 0.22wt.%Cu/BST. As can be seen, κ of the pristine BST decreases firstly to the lowest value of 1.14 Wm−1K−1 at 323 K, and then increases to 1.82 Wm−1 K−1 with increasing the temperature, while κ of 0.22wt.%Cu/BST decreases from 1.75 to 1.37 Wm−1 K−1 at the same temperature range. The annealed BST and annealed 0.22wt.%Cu/BST have the same decreasing trend of κ. The annealed 0.22wt.%Cu/BST has a κ of 0.4 Wm−1K−1, which is lower than that of BST and 0.22wt.%Cu/BST. The κe is well described by the Wiedemann–Franz’s law , κe = LσT, where L is the Lorenz number, estimated using a single parabolic band (SPB) model with acoustic phonon scattering, shown in (e). As can be seen, κe of 0.22wt.%Cu/BST and annealed 0.22wt.%Cu/BST enhances due to the great increase of σ. The κl is further calculated by subtracting the κe from the κ, as shown in (f). From which, κl in 0.22wt.%Cu/BST and annealed 0.22wt.%Cu/BST are remarkably declined, and the lowest κl is 0.30 Wm−1K−1 at 321 K for annealed 0.22wt.%Cu/BST, approaching the extreme limited value in BST .
