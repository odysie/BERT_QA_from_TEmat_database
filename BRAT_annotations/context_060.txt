In our material, we determined a planar fault density of NPF=1.6⋅10^8m−1 at the LAGB, which is similar to the estimated minimum value of NPF=1.3⋅10^8m−1 required to have a notable impact on the thermal conductivity. On the other hand, the planar fault density inside the grain was found to be much lower NPF=1.5⋅10^6m−1. It is noteworthy that the LAGBs in this study are primarily parallel to the solidification direction, as discussed at the beginning of the section. Such microstructure is expected to scatter more phonons travelling in a radial direction, thereby deterring the heat flow in the radial direction more efficiently. A polycrystalline microstructure would make such effect more isotropic. In order to make phonon scattering by planar faults more significant, the material needs more volume of LAGBs with a high density of planar faults. For example, as reported by Hong et al. [], AgSbTe1.85Se0.15 with a very fine polycrystalline grain size of ∼2 μm and a high number of planar faults has a lattice thermal conductivity of <0.4 W m−1 K−1 at room temperature.
