At 25 °C, the conductivity value of [HANI]Cl/(CH2OH)2 is 0.32 S m-1 and that of [HANI]NO3/(CH2OH)2 is 0.28 S m-1. These two values are greater than that of the traditional IL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([BMIM]PF6) (0.14 S m-1). Viscosity tests show that the viscosity of [HANI]Cl/(CH2OH)2 is 32 cP and that of [HANI]NO3/(CH2OH)2 is 26 cP at 25 °C. These two viscosity values are greater than that of water (1 cP), but far less than that of [BMIM]PF6 (280 cP). The high conductivity and low viscosity of DES are benefit for the electropolymerization of aniline.
