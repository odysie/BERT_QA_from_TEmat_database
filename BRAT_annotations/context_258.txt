P–type SnS compound and SnS1-xSex solid solutions were successfully prepared by mechanical alloying combined with spark plasma sintering. High anisotropy among all the transport properties has been observed, i.e. higher PF and σ along the direction perpendicular to the SPS–pressurizing direction than the parallel one. Se substitution subsequently increased the hole carrier concentration from 9.02 × 10^14 cm-3 in SnS to 2.10 × 10^17 cm-3 in SnS0.2Se0.8, which results in increased σ and PF. A high ZT value of 0.64 has been obtained for the composition SnS0.2Se0.8 at 823 K along the direction // to the SPS–pressuring direction due to the reduced κ and optimized PF. SnS and all the SnS1-xSex solid solutions exhibit higher thermoelectric performance along the direction parallel to the SPS–pressurizing direction than the other one. Moreover, although a low κ of 0.36 at 823 K was observed in SnS0.5Se0.5, its maximum ZT value 0.45 is still lower than the SnS0.2Se0.8 owing to its low σ and PF. However, both compositions (SnS0.5Se0.5, SnS0.2Se0.8) are promising candidates for further thermoelectric investigations towards higher performance through proper p–type doping to increase σ and PF.
