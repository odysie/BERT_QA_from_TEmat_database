The power factor of AgBiSe2 and AgSbSe2 is plotted in Fig. 6. Unannealed AgSbSe2 exhibits the largest power factor, with a peak value of 437 μW m−1 K−2 at 590 K. However, the power factor of AgSbSe2 decreases after annealing due to the enhancement of electrical resistivity. Unannealed AgBiSe2 and annealed AgBiSe2 have the same variation trend of power factor: it increases with increasing temperature below 480 K, then decreases in the γ phase temperature range, and finally increases again above 580 K. Although the power factor of AgBiSe2 increases after annealing in the entire temperature range, the maximum value 207 μW m−1 K−2 at 480 K is still relatively low.
