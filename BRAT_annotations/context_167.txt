Though the presence of NbO2 as a secondary phase may indirectly limit the carriers generated from A-site filling, it is speculated that it may also lower the conductivity by lessening the contribution of the high conductivity c-axis. Reduction of unfilled SBN single crystals showed that NbO2 preferentially forms on the surface perpendicular to the c-axis. The electrical conductivity of NbO2 was reported to be 40 S/cm at about 650 K. Since SBN has a higher conductivity along the c-axis, the nucleation of more resistive NbO2 at the c-axis surface could potentially affect the conduction across grain boundaries in ceramic samples. The conductivity of NbO2 as reported by Janninck et al. increases drastically at higher temperatures to ~250 S/cm at 1000 K and ~500 S/cm at ~1300 K. The abrupt increase in conductivity in NbO2 may also explain why the conductivity of unfilled SBN at higher temperatures falls off less slowly than the filled SBN as shown in Fig. 4.
