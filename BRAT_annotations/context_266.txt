where
kB is the Boltzmann constant and the Fermi integral can be obtained from the Seebeck coefficients in Fig. 5b (see eqn (4)). The range of the L values is from 1.5 to 1.7. Due to the poor electrical conductivity, the lattice thermal conductivity is close to the total thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity are significantly reduced by PbBr2 doping. For example, the room temperature thermal conductivity is 1.88 W m−1 K−1 in SnSe0.95, and it decreases to 1.23 W m−1 K−1 in SnSe0.95–3% PbBr2. In the whole temperature range, the thermal conductivity of all the samples roughly decreases with increasing temperature, and the lowest value is 0.6 W m−1 K−1 in SnSe0.95–2% PbBr2 at 793 K.
