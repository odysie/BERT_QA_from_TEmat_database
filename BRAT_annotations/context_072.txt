When compared the TE performance of SnSe thin film sample deposited at a glancing angle with its bulk single crystal counterpart , the film in the present study has a lower operation temperature than the bulk material. For the bulk material, the SnSe single crystal has the highest power factor of 10.1μWcm−1K−2 at ∼973 K. The lower operation temperature of the thin film compared to the bulk single crystal may be due to the reduction of material dimension. Compared to the SnSe thin films deposited by other researchers , the room temperature Seebeck coefficient of the sample in the present study (262.2μV/K) is lower, while the room-temperature Seebeck coefficients in previous study on different substrates were from 432μV/K to 505μV/K. Compared to the bulk single crystal SnSe , the increasing trend of out-of-plane thin film thermal conductivity is different from that of bulk SnSe, which has a decreasing trend. The films in this study have much lower thermal conductivities, and we believe that the difference should be due to the grain and surface boundary scattering. Since the out-of-plane thermal conductivity cannot be used directly with in-plane electrical properties to evaluate zT, we will not give a particular value of zT in this paper, even based on a very conservative estimation the zT value could be much higher than the bulk single crystal. We will report the in-plane thermal conductivity and zT value elsewhere.
