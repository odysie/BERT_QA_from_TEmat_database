One can see that from with increasing content of substituted Te, the resistivity of Zn4(Sb1−xTex)3 (x = 0, 0.005 and 0.02) decreases: viz., the magnitude at room temperature decreases from 2.25 mΩ cm for x = 0–0.684 mΩ cm for x = 0.02. The metallic conduction behavior and decrease in electrical resistivity is believed to result from the excess metal Zn in the Zn4(Sb1−xTex)3 structure. Sb in Zn4Sb3 presents two kinds of state - Sb3− and Sb24- dimmers . Since ionic radius of Te− (2.50 Å) are similar to that of Sb3− (2.45 Å), Te doping in Zn4Sb3 presents a valence state of Te−. So, if the substitution of Te for Sb happens, only a composition of Zn3.95(Sb0.98Te0.02)3 can maintain a charge balance. The room temperature Hall coefficient for metal Zn is +0.33 × 10−4 cm3/C, which means the excess Zn in our Te-doped sample will supply holes. Carrier concentration of metal Zn is 1.89 × 10^23/cm3. This is larger than that of β-Zn4Sb3 (9 × 10^19/cm3), leading to an increase in the carrier concentration and resulting in a decrease in electrical resistivity. The room temperature resistivity of 2.25 × 10−5 Ω m was obtained for our Zn4Sb3 sample. This is in good agreement with the reported one . However, our value is about twofold as large as that (0.8 × 10−5 Ω m) reported by Souma et al. , this difference arises due to the different microstructures (such as porosity and grain sizes) of the samples obtained by using different sintering techniques (hot-pressing was used in the present study and spark plasma sintering was used by them).
