Reduction or oxygen vacancy doping is the most successful driver to higher thermoelectric performance. It leads to a large increase in the carrier mobility (Hall mobility in the range of 10 cm2/Vs), increase in the effective mass up to m* = 8 and to additional increase in the carrier concentration. After reduction, niobium-doped strontium titanate can reach an electrical conductivity of 15,000 S/m at 1,000 K and preserve a Seebeck coefficient of -250 Î¼V/K, so that, at similar thermal conductivity, the figure of merit is dramatically increased to ZT = 0.25 (1,000 K). At the same level of reduction, donor dopants play an important role in reduced material and drive the electrical conductivity to higher values, while the Seebeck coefficient is hardly altered, so that the figure of merit is continuously improved with increasing donor dopant level.
