Similar to lead-free SnTe, chalcogenide MnTe with typical hexagonal NiAs crystal structure was also reported to be a potential candidate for middle-temperature thermoelectric applications. MnTe possesses a large Seebeck coefficient and a low thermal conductivity, but a huge electrical resistivity makes MnTe be an inferior thermoelectric material. To improve the poor electrical resistivity of MnTe, J. Y. Yang et al. found that Cu is an effective dopant that could increase the hole concentration and boost the electrical conductivity of MnTe . A promising maximum ZT of 0.55 was achieved in the Mn0.925Cu0.075Te sample at 773 K, which is improved by 35% in comparison to the undoped MnTe.
