c shows the power factor of NaxSn1-xSe samples measured along the direction perpendicular to the SPS compressing. The power factor of undoped SnSe is very small at low temperature and elevates to 290 μWm−1K−2 at 798 K. The highest power factor of about 470 μWm−1K−2 is achieved in Na0.02Sn0.98Se at 798 K, comparable to the best values achieved in p-doped polycrystalline SnSe synthesized under ambient pressure . In addition, the power factor of our high pressure synthesized Na0.02Sn0.98Se maintains a relatively high value (>300 μWm−1K−2) when temperature is higher than 500 K, which is beneficial to the overall thermoelectric performance of SnSe.
