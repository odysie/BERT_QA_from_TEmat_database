. At room temperature, the electrical conductivity of the Sr substituted samples increases slightly with the increasing Sr content because the Sr ion is larger in diameter than Ca ion. However, the electrical conductivity of Ca3Co4O9+δ is higher than all the Sr containing samples. The pellet of Ca3Co4O9+δ is sintered at 1100°C, but those of Sr substituted samples are sintered at 920°C. The higher electrical conductivity of Ca3Co4O9+δ is perhaps related to its lower intergrain resistivity of the pellet for measurement. The electrical conductivity of Ca3Co4O9+δ increases slightly with increasing temperature, and the value is 83.4 S cm−1 at 700°C. A transition of the conducting type from semiconductor to metal was observed above 700 K for the Sr substituted samples with x=0.5 and 1.0. Similar behavior has been reported for other oxides with perovskite type structure, such as Ln2SrCo2O7 and La1−xSrxCoO3.
