It has been found that Group IIIA elements have a potential to control the carrier type and carrier concentration in PbSe . For example, the addition of thallium (Tl) in PbSe shows a p-type nature. Properties of PbSe do not increase drastically with incorporation of Tl because it cannot be doped while melting . It has been observed that with increasing Tl dopant concentration electrical conductivity of PbSe increases, but Seebeck coefficient and power factor decrease drastically . Also by Tl doping, there is some band modification near the Fermi level of PbSe causing reduction of Seebeck coefficient and power factor. It has been observed that high density of state, effective mass, and Hall carrier mobility decrease electrical conductivity of Tl doped PbSe causing low Seebeck coefficient and power factor. 0.01 wt% of Tl doped PbSe shows maximum Seebeck coefficient of 248 μV/K at 723 K. The highest zT and power factor of the same composition at 723 K are ∼1 and 0.98 mW/m.K2. For some composition (0.01 wt%) of Tl doped PbSe at room temperature, Seebeck coefficient, zT and power factor are 82.80 μV/K, 0.05 and 0.27, respectively. The decrease in thermal conductivity is governed by the phonon scattering effect. Tl3+ ion is heavier than Pb2+ and it results in stronger phonon scattering as well as there is some increased mid to long range phonon scattering due to the increase of boundary scattering .
