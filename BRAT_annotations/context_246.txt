Considering that the room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity of SbCrSe3 is 1.08 W m-1 K-1 and that of Pb0.05Sb0.95Cr5Se8 is 0.78 W m-1 K-1, Pb doping depressed κL by 28%. This reduction indicates that the Pb/Sb disorder in the Sb sublattice strongly enhanced the phonon scattering (details are in the Supporting Information). In Figure 7a, the experimental data followed the same trend that was predicted by the model, although the experimental data are to some degree higher than the calculated values. Γmass and Γstrain are plotted in Figure 7b. It is clear that the value of Γstrain is much larger than that of Γmass. This demonstrates that strain field fluctuations, which were introduced by substituting Pb in the Sb sublattice, are the dominant factor in the point-defect scattering of phonons and led to a significantly decreased lattice thermal conductivity in Pb-doped SbCrSe3 compounds. The large strain field fluctuation contribution is related to the local structural distortion between the double-ladder chains. Figure 7c shows the local coordination environment of the Sb and Pb atoms between the ferromagnetism chains of SbCrSe3 (left) and Pb0.0625Sb0.9375CrSe3 (right), which was based on the DFT optimization. In SbCrSe3, the Sb atom was coordinated with three Se atoms and formed almost equidistant bond lengths (2.689 Å, 2.689 Å and 2.714 Å) that produced a relatively stable triangular pyramid between the double-ladder chains. However, when an impurity Pb atom was introduced, the Pb atoms were more inclined to form bonds with the Se atoms on the neighboring chain, which resulted in the coordination number of the Pb atom of four (3.139 Å, 2.998 Å, 2.818 Å and 2.818 Å). Moreover, the originally relatively stable triangular pyramid became a relatively unstable square pyramid. Therefore, the location of the Pb atom in Pb0.0625Sb0.9375CrSe3 deviated from the original relatively stable location of the Sb atom in SbCrSe3, which led to additional local distortion. The large differences in the coupling forces of a Se atom with Pb and a Se atom with Sb are expected to produce to a strong strain fluctuation contribution in the phonon scattering. A similarly strong strain fluctuation contribution arising from the presence of impurity atoms was also observed in CuFeS2 and Cu2Zn1-xFexGeSe4.
