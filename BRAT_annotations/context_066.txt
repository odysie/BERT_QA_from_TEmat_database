BAs [] (∼1500 Wm−1K−1) along c-direction. According Zhang's report, the GaGeTe monolayer remains its thermally stable phase above 600 K, and will be destroyed when considering its high temperatures between 600 and 900 K []. At 600 K, the calculated lattice thermal conductivity of GaGeTe monolayer are 28.23 Wm−1K−1. When considering its high temperature region (600–800 K), GaGeTe monolayer will further realize an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity due to enhanced intrinsic anharmonic scattering from thermal population of higher-frequency phonons. With temperature increasing, the thermal conductivity gradually decreases to a constant value of 20 Wm−1K−1 at 800 K. The excellent thermal stability ensures it could work above room temperature, promising for further gains in electronic device performance operating at room temperature region.
