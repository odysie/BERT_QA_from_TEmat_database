Until recently, the only properties known about the layered structure VII were microhardness and resistance to alkalis and organic solvents []. Now, due to the inconsistent reports of structures within this composition range, there is almost too much property data available. For example, the room temperature electrical conductivities of DyCuTe2 and ErCuTe2 are an order of magnitude lower (12.5 S/cm and 50 S/cm respectively) [] when reported in the monoclinic space group (XIV) than they are in their most recent report (∼840 S/cm and ∼950 S/cm respectively) [] as trigonal structures (IX). Meanwhile, compared to their trigonal counterparts the room temperature Seebeck coefficient is markedly lower for ErCuTe2, (39 μV/K for XIV vs ∼60 μV/K for IX) but higher for DyCuTe2 (144 μV/K for XIV vs ∼100 μV/K for IX) [,]. Recent reports of structure XIV on Cu doping in GdCu1+xTe2 also demonstrate a range of conductivities of 33–58 S/cm as well as a range of Seebeck coefficients of 172–236 μV/K (leading to an overall maximum zT of 0.21 at 540 K for GdCu1.25Te2) [], however there is no data on a structure IX analogue available for comparison. As the temperature rises, IX structure transitions to its HTP of VII, finally allowing for some of its electronic properties to be tested. From a thermoelectric standpoint, this is where the most fruitful discoveries have been. TmCuTe2 was the first representative to report notable mid/high temperature zT values with a maximum of 0.81 at 745 K []. Next was a report of YCuTe2, which utilized intrinsic doping of Cu to reach an appreciable zT of 0.75 at 780 K []. Finally, testing of (Tb-Er)CuTe2 was completed, yielding the highest value to date within the R-M-Te family of structures for TbCuTe2 with zT = 1.0 at 750 K []. With the incorporation of other thermoelectric optimization techniques, these structures show great promise.
