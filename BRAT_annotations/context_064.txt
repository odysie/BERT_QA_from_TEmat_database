Te layers by van der Waals interactions, is an intrinsic semiconductor with a band gap of 1.12 eV []. Anisotropic intrinsic lattice thermal conductivity of polycrystalline GaGeTe has been measured to be 0.8 and 1.3 Wm−1K−1 at 475 K along with x and y directions. Such low thermal conductivity could be ascribed to the presence of intrinsic native defect in the crystal lattice []. In addition, Raman spectrum and lattice dynamics of 3D GaGeTe compound from experiments [] help unveil its whole phonon dispersion and structural or dimensional variants. Accordingly, understanding thermal properties and lattice dynamics of 2D GaGeTe material is beneficial for applications in the developments of thermal interface materials, thermoelectric energy conversion, and thermal coating materials [,]. In addition, the vibrational modes and phonon frequencies can give basic elemental information of the materials and help understand experimental characterizations mostly arising from lattice vibrations []. In this work, we have systematically studied the phonon dispersions, Raman spectroscopy, group velocity, Grüneisen constants, and temperature-dependent thermal conductivity of GaGeTe. Our results give a guidance of experimental measurements on the thermal conductivity and frequency shift of Raman and IR modes under external strain.
