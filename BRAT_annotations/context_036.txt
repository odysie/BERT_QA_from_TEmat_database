The figure of merit, zT, was calculated between 300 and 532 K for all samples for the first set of samples and presented in (b). The highest value of the figure of merit, ∼0.4, was obtained at 375–400 K for the sample Bi1.99Cr0.01Te3. Although lower zT are generally obtained for n-type Bi2Te3 compared to p-type Bi2Te3, the low thermoelectric efficiency of our samples is associated with the lack of carrier concentration optimization. We also purposely sintered at the lowest SPS temperature which provided us with samples with relative density of over 98%. Sintering at high temperatures can result in inhomogeneity of Bi2Te3 samples in terms of composition and introduces defects which both effect on the electronic transport properties, and may lead to one-off high zT, but which may also not be stable in long-term applications at high temperatures. The highest zT values for n-type Bi2Te3-based compounds (∼1) are achieved in nanostructured Bi2Te3–Bi2Se3 alloys at optimised carrier concentrations, doped with Cu, which is also an element with magnetic moment. The aim of this study was to decouple the effect of magnetism and the carrier concentration–related effect to prove the importance of magnetism on thermoelectricity; this was not viable to achieve in complex chemistries, and therefore, we demonstrated the magnetic enhancement effect in this way. Nevertheless, with x = 0.01, the figure of merit shows an increase of roughly 25% compared to the undoped compound, at constant carrier concentration. The magnetic doping, leading to magnetic interaction with the carriers driving the increased S and leading to decreased κlatt, due to the point defect scattering, results in the observed enhancement in zT. For the other compounds, the slight variations of n and the loss of the magnetic coupling of the carriers due to intercalation of the Cr ions prevent samples to achieve higher values of zT.
