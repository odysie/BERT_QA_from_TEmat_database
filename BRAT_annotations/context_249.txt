To fabricate optoelectronics device by new innovative materials it is very urgent to study the electrical properties of that materials. Figure 6 shows the schematic diagram of hall measurement set up to study the electrical properties of SnS nanofilm. The variation of electrical conductivity with substrate temperature in the temperature range 300–345 K is depicted in Fig. 7a. From the Fig. 7a it is clear that with increase in substrate temperature the conductivity of the SnS nanofilms (14 °C SnS, 30 °C SnS and 70 °C SnS) increase which indicates the semiconducting behavior of the nanocrystals. Grain size take plays an important role for the variation of electrical conductivity with substrate temperature. Also smaller the crystal size higher is the resistivity. The room temperature (300 K) conductivity of the 14 °C SnS, 30 °C SnS and 70 °C SnS nanofilm were 0.020 Ohm-1 cm-1, 0.025 Ohm-1 cm-1 and 0.037 Ohm-1 cm-1, respectively. M. Calixto-Rodriguez et al. studied on tin sulfide thin film grown by spray pyrolysis and reported conductivity value was ~ 10^-4 Ohm-1 cm-1. N. Koteeswara Reddy et al. reported electrical conductivity of ~ 0.033 Ohm-1 cm-1 for tin sulfide films prepared by spray pyrolysis in the temperature range 100 °C–450 °C. The reported conductivity at room temperature was 0.193 Ohm-1 cm-1 and 0.063 Ohm-1 cm-1 for parallel and perpendicular layers plane of SnS single crystals, respectively, studied by Nassary. Hegde et al. reported electrical conductivity 0.008 Ohm-1 cm-1 of SnS semiconductor crystals grown by physical vapor deposition technique. The activation energy of the SnS nanofilms was calculated from the Arrhenius equation. where σ is the electrical conductivity of the SnS nanofilms, σ0 is the pre-exponential factor, k is the Boltzmann constant and Ea is the activation energy of the SnS nanofilms. A plot ln σ versus 1/T is shown in Fig. 7b. Activation energies (Ea) of the SnS nanofilms were evaluated from the slop of the curve. 0.864 eV, 0.731 eV and 0.584 eV are the measured values of the activation energies of 14 °C SnS, 30 °C SnS and 70 °C SnS nanofilm, respectively. Hegde et al. studied on SnS crystals grown by vapor deposition technique and reported activation energy 0.34 eV above 275 K. Reddy et al. showed activation energy of 0.081 eV and 0.091 eV for 0.3 μm and 0.6 μm thick SnS film. Paul et al. reported that the thermal activation energy of
