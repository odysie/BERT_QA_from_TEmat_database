. The negative values indicate the presence of n-type semiconductor. Since pure BSO was used as the insulator, the S value could not be measured. The measured S values are monotonically increased with the increase in temperature. The S values were similar for the Sb-substituted BSO (Sb: 5 mM) and Sb-substituted BSO (Sb: 10 mM) up to 800 K. When the temperature increased beyond 800 K, a slight change in the S values was observed. The difference was 2.44 μV/K. The S value of Sb-substituted BSO (Sb: 10 mM) was 58.9 μV/K at 820 K, which was higher than that of Sb-substituted BSO (Sb: 5 mM) 56.4 μV/K at the same temperature.
