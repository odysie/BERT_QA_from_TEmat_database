As can be seen from Table 1, the resistivity of Ca0.75Er0.25MnO3-δpowders decreases significantly after Er-doping, approximately two orders of magnitude lower than that of CaMnO3 powders. And the resistivity of Ca0.75Er0.25MnO3-δ powders has first decreased then increased, and presents V-trend with increase in calcination temperature, showing the typical electronic doping characteristics. When the calcination temperature is 1,000 °C, the resistivity of Ca0.75Er0.25MnO3-δ powders reaches the minimum value of 0.8013 Ω m.
