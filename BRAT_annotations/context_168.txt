Since 2000, layer cobalt oxides Ca3Co4O9 has attracted much attention as a potential high temperature thermoelectric material for the coexistence of high thermopower and metallic transport behavior. At 1000 K, the electrical resistivity and the Seebeck coefficient of the single crystal Ca3Co4O9 are about 0.9 mΩ cm and 280 µV/K, respectively, which makes the ZT get to 0.8, very close to 1, that is considered as the lower limit for the practical use. Unfortunately, the large bulk of Ca3Co4O9 single crystal is difficult to prepare. Therefore, the researchers have to pay more attention to preparing polycrystalline Ca3Co4O9 ceramics and improving their thermoelectric performances. In past years, the way to enhance the thermoelectric performance of Ca3Co4O9 ceramics was related to these methods: (1) doping in Ca site or Co site to adjust carrier concentration to optimize Seebeck coefficient or electrical resistivity, (2) micro-structure controlled for achieving high level textured materials to increase the conductivities and Seebeck coefficient, (3) nano-structured for increasing the density of state of the carrier to improve the Seebeck coefficient, and reducing photon contribution to the thermal conductivity, (4) introducing the second phase for preparing the composites to optimize the thermoelectric parameters based on the mixing laws.
