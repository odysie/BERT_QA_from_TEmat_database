Reduced titania Magnéli phases TinO2n-1 have been object of numerous studies since their discovery by Magnéli himself. Early work on Magnéli phases TiO1.94–1.86 (fabricated from anatase powder by reduction in H2 at high temperature and subsequent cold pressing) advanced the hypothesis of ZT(350 K) = 0.2 and, based on experimental Seebeck coefficient of -0.5 mV/K at 70 °C and extremely optimistic assumptions (not measured) on the thermal conductivity, possibly much better high-temperature values. Those assumptions were proven wrong by later work. In, various reduced rutile and Magnéli phases were processed and their electrical and thermal properties measured; ZT(1,000 K) was not found to exceed 0.2.
