The Seebeck coefficients plotted in Fig. 6(d) also showed an increasing trend with temperature in the range 300–600 K for all the compositions, consistent with their p-type semiconducting behavior. For pristine Cu2Te, the Seebeck coefficient reached a peak value of ~45 μV/K, quite close to those reported for the directly annealed Cu2Te pellets at 600 K. With the incorporation of Ga doping, considerable enhancement of the thermopower was further achieved with the peak S value obtained in the case of Cu1.97Ga0.03Te (Speak = 70 μV/K). The peak thermopower values in Cu1.97Ga0.03Te and Cu1.95Ga0.05Te were about 2 and 1.5 times (Fig. 7b) respectively that of pristine Cu2Te at 600 K, which significantly promoted the thermoelectric performance. Power factor measurements, which is a yardstick for determining heat losses in TE, were also performed for the compositions as shown in Fig. 6(e). All the compositions except Cu1.95Ga0.05Te exhibited an increasing trend of power factor with temperature. This was due to the fact, that in Cu1.97Ga0.03Te, S exhibited a decreasing trend in the temperature range 450–550 K due to the opposing effect of minority and majority charge carriers quite common in narrow band semiconductors. At room temperatures, incorporation of Ga doping of 5% enhanced the power factor to 1.5 μW/K2cm, which was a 25% enhancement from that obtained in the spark-plasma sintered Cu2Te pellets at 300 K. Maximum PF of 2.3 μW/K2cm at 600 K was achieved in case of Cu1.97Ga0.03Te. In essence, the thermopower and the power factors was comparable to the state of the art TE materials like skutterudite CoSb3 and CuCrSe2. With respect to pristine Cu2Te, the highest enhancements (3–3.5) in PF were achieved between 300–400 K for Cu1.97Ga0.03Te, but at higher temperatures of 400–600 K, the composition Cu1.95Ga0.05Te showed the highest PF enhancements of 2–1.5 (Fig. 7c). On the other hand, 1% doping of Ga resulted in a decrease in the PF particularly in the temperature zone of 300–400 K.
