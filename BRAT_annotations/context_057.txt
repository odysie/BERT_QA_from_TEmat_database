Promising TE materials have small κ- values. In particular, it is important to reduce their lattice contribution to κ as much as possible by introducing various phonon scattering centers in the matrix. The AgSbTe2-δ-phase has an intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity in the order of κl=0.68Wm−1K−1 at 400 K, due to its glass like phonon scattering [,,], and its unconventional chemical mechanism as shown recently by Min Zhu et al. []. The highest zT factor that has been measured for the pristine AgSbTe2 bulk materials was 1.3 at 720 K [,,], Solid solutions of AgSbTe2 with GeTe and PbTe alloys, such as the quaternary compounds Pb-Ag-Sb-Te [,]and (AgSbTe2)1-x(GeTe)x [], exhibit higher TE performance e.g. zT = 1.7 at 700 K for (AgSbTe2)9.09(PbTe)90.91 reported in Hsu et al. [].
