To further enhance zT in (Bi0.25Sb0.75)2Te3, optimizing both the thermal and electronic properties will be required. Recently, a high zT (1.86 at 320 K) was reported in (Bi0.25Sb0.75)2Te3 as a result of thermal conductivity reduction by phonon engineering through dislocations . In addition to the reduced thermal conductivity, excess Te and relatively low hole concentration probably leads to charge carrier optimization of the electronic properties as well. The maximum attainable electronic performance of a thermoelectric material is proportional to the quality factor , which in turn depends on the number of Fermi pockets (Nv) . Because Nv is not coupled to any other property related to zT, converging separate carrier pockets provides a straightforward strategy for improving zT. While previous experiments on (Bi1âˆ’xSbx)2Te3 assumed single band behaviour when describing the electronic properties, we show that convergence of multiple bands is a viable improvement strategy in this system as well.
