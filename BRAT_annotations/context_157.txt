where Fj is the Fermi integrals, η = EF/kBT is the reduced Fermi level, EF is the Fermi level estimated by band gaps. The calculated Lorenz numbers for different Te contents have been shown in . On the basis of the κele obtained in , the κlat is thus achieved and plotted in (b), revealing a systemic reduction over the measured temperature range due to the effect of temperature rise on the lattice vibration. As is well known, the BiCuSeO-based materials possess intrinsically low thermal conductivity, which originates from its unique natural superlattice structure and weak bonding between layers []. Zhao et al. had attempted to calculate minimum lattice thermal conductivity using the minimum interatomic distance (d = lPh, ∼3 Å) as the phonon mean free path (PMFP), which is the κlat,min of 0.47 W m−1K−1 at 300 K for the BiCuSeO system []. It is much lower than our κlat values at initial temperature for pristine and Te-doped BiCuSeO, suggesting that a further reduction in κlat is feasible using rational optimization. In addition, we notice that the lattice thermal conductivity exhibits a decrease and then an increase with Te contents, which may be attributed to the typical microstructures and the competitive effects of lattice disorder and changed PMFP induced by Te substitution. The microstructural features of BiCuSe0.9Te0.1O are investigated again to seek the probable reason of lower lattice thermal conductivity. As shown in , the abundant structural modulations can be readily observed in the same area, which are known as an evidence for the presence of interior strain [], inducing the production of atomic-scale defects to promote the scatter of phonons. Additionally, with increasing Te contents, the interatomic distance as PMFP will obviously increase due to the weaker electronegativity and larger atomic radius of Te, leading to the weakened phonon scattering becoming dominant, and then a slight enhancement in κlat for heavier Te-doped BiCuSeO system.
