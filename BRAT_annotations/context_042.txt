These results from the literature emphasize the need for sufficient power output in these types of devices. The ZT value of materials used and structure of the devices significantly affect the output power and voltage. For example, Hyland, et al. reported the effect of heat spreader material, heat spreader size, and sandwich device structure, etc. on the output powers of the flexible TEG fabricated by 25 pairs of p-type and n-type bismuth telluride. The flexible TEG was applied on the wrist, upper arm, chest, and T-shirt, respectively, and the highest output power ∼20 μW/cm2 was obtained when applied on the upper arm with air speed at about 1.4 m/s. They also found that it is more convenient to wear when the TEG was suspended on the T-shirt, but in this case the output power is the least when compared to the TEG applied on different locations on a human body. The ZT value of the screen-printed Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 films can be almost doubled up to 0.90 at room temperature via a post ionized defect engineering method by reducing the bismuth oxide particles in the as-prepared films. This value is almost as high as the bulk Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 materials. With 72 TE pairs a flexible generator of size 40 mm × 40 mm × 0.8 mm fabricated by p-type Bi0.5Sb1.5Se0.3 and treated n-type Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 is reported to generate an open-circle voltage 693 mV, and a power density 6.32 mW/cm2 at a temperature difference of 25.6 K . Most recently, Kim et al. fabricated a flexible TEG with p- and n-type Bi-Te based alloy legs (1.0 mm × 2.5 mm) on the patterned copper thin film, and then filled the empty space in the TEG with a proprietary polymer material, as a result, a power density of 2.28 μW/cm2 was achieved.
