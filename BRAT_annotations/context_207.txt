Experimentally, the IV-VI compounds GeS, GeSe and SnS all crystallize in GeS-type structure which belongs to the orthorhombic structure with space group Pnma. However, studies on the thermoelectric properties of these orthorhombic compounds except for SnSe are few, and there is not a comparison of thermoelectric performance among them. Recently, Tan et al. experimentally found a modest ZT of 0.6 at 873 K in polycrystalline SnS, which is comparable to those measured in polycrystalline SnSe. Here, in order to search for more high-performance thermoelectric materials, we investigate and compare the thermoelectric properties of the orthorhombic IV–VI compounds by using the density function theory combined with the Boltzmann transport equation. We reveal that GeS, GeSe and SnS show similar thermoelectric properties to that of SnSe: large Seebeck coefficient, high power factor and low thermal conductivity. Importantly, the Seebeck coefficients of GeS,GeSe and SnS are even larger than that of SnSe under the studied carrier concentration and temperature region. Moreover, the Seebeck coefficients and power factors can be greatly enhanced by both n-type and p-type doping.
