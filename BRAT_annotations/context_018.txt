Pt and Pd, are metallic with high conductivity. PdCoO2 is the most conductive oxide known so far with an electrical resistivity in the ab-plane of 4.69 μΩ cm at room temperature, which is less than for pure Pd . Although delafossite-structured materials have been known for 140 years, the research interest in this type of materials has increased after the first report on the preparation of transparent p-type CuAlO2 thin films by Kawazoe and co-workers in 1997 . This opened up the possibility to use delafossites as transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), since p-type TCOs are required in many practical applications based on p-n junctions. Since then, delafossites, especially those based on Cu and Ag, have received considerable attention owing to their potential applications as e.g. p-type TCOs , photocatalysts , anode material for Li-batteries , thermoelectrical materials , and gas sensor . Recently, high temperature superconductivity was also suggested for doped members of this type of oxide compounds .
