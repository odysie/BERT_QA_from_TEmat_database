S alloyed Bi2Te3 having high thermoelectric performance in terms of ZT~1.2 have been synthesized by solid state method. Strong correlation is found between structural and thermoelectric properties. Structural studies confirm the enhancement in lattice defects/disorder and volume defects created by S doping, which creates highly strained lattice. These lattice defects combined with bulk defects scatter the charge carriers and phonons to provide a moderate Seebeck coefficient of ~240 μV/K and low lattice thermal conductivity of ~0.53 W/m.K with a ZT of ~1.2 at 413 K for highly doped Bi2Te2S materials. Reports suggested that in order to achieve high thermoelectric efficiency in Bi2Te3, either a complex synthesis route or toxic dopant is required. But, in the current study, improved ZT is achieved in Bi2Te3 by using non-toxic S dopant with simple and economic solid-state synthesis routes. Hence, incorporation of S in Bi2Te3 could be a viable technique to attain high thermoelectric performance.
