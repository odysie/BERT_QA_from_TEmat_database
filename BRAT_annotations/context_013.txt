The ZT value of β-Zn4Sb3 has been elevated through many approaches, such as developing new synthesis methods [], elemental doping and nano-structuring [,]. The traditional strategy for boosting ZT of β-Zn4Sb3 is to adjust the carrier concentration and lower thermal conductivity simultaneously by doping. For instance, dopants such as Pb, Bi, Mg, Cu, Sn, In, Cd, Al, Ga, Nb, Hg, Co, Te, I, Se, Fe and Ag have been investigated so far []. However, the results showed that although the individual parameters were affected by doping, there was a little or no overall improvement of its thermoelectric performance. The main reasons lie in the following factors: (i) thermal conductivity of β-Zn4Sb3 is very low (<1 W m−1K−1) [,,] which is close to the practical lower limit for the thermal conductivity in solids []; this means that there is no much room in lowering its thermal conductivity; (ii) the hole concentration of pristine β-Zn4Sb3 is in the order of 10^24∼10^25 m−3 [,,], which indicates that its carrier concentration has already been close to the optimum. These characters of β-Zn4Sb3 mentioned here suggest that it is difficult to enhance its thermoelectric performance remarkably through doping, unless the Seebeck coefficient S can be extra elevated upon doping. This is extremely important to the material system since the Seebeck coefficient of β-Zn4Sb3 is relatively small (around 100 μV/K at room temperature [,,,,]), and only when large S is achieved can the thermoelectric performance of β-Zn4Sb3 be improved substantially.
