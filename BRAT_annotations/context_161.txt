 we present our results of non-doped Cu2O obtained by CSD at high temperature. The layer has been deposited from a metalorganic solution compatible with inkjet printing technology onto a flexible metallic tape MgO/Hastelloy. The SEM image shows a compact surface with a good crystallinity. Some electrical properties have been studied by Hall effect measurement in a temperature and applied magnetic field range of 240–400 K and 0–9.5 T, respectively. At 298 K the measured resistivity and hole concentration are 130 Ωcm and 10^16 cm-3, respectively, which are reasonable values for non-doped Cu2O.
