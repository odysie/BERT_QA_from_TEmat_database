In this work, we report a serious of magnetic Ni ions doped Cu2GeSe3-based compounds. As expected, the carrier concentration is enhanced significantly due to the acceptor role of Ni ions with the unpaired 3d electrons. DFT calculations demonstrate that the unpaired Ni 3d states contribute to the hybridization of Ni 3d orbitals with Se 4p orbitals near the Fermi level, leading to an increase of DOS. Meanwhile, the substitution of Ni for Ge causes the obvious local distortions in Cu2GeSe3 lattice, which yields the large strain fluctuations to suppress the lattice thermal conductivity. The experimental lattice thermal conductivity fits well with the calculated values according to the Callaway model as the point defect is considered. As a result, the Cu2Ge0.9Ni0.1Se3 sample possesses a remarkably high power factor of ∼7.5 μW cm−1 K−2 and a peak ZT of ∼0.38 at 723 K.
