From the values of ΔVs and ΔTA–B, the ΔVs/ΔTA–B
= 0.155 mV/K. This corresponds to the Seebeck coefficient of B-doped SiGe thin film of micro-THS and the value is relatively in good agreement with the other experimental result . The Seebeck coefficient of the B-doped SiGe thin film using different method at 100 °C was 0.115 mV/K, where the Seebeck coefficient was evaluated from the slope of regression equation of thermo-voltage as a function of temperature difference . The discrepancy of 30% might be partially due to the difference between ΔTA–B of the surface of thick film catalyst and that of thermoelectric materials.
