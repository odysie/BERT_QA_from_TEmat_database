Bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) exhibits an inherently high ZT ~ 1.3 near room temperature [] due to a combination of narrow bandgap [], complex crystal structure [], degenerate bands [] and high density of states near the Fermi level []. Adding alloying elements, together with nanostructuring, can substantially increase the ZT in bulk pellets of this material [,,]. For example, Sb additions [] to Bi2Te3 yield 1.4 ≤ ZT ≤ 1.9 at room temperature in bulk nanocrystalline p-type BixSb2-xTe3 pellets [] with x = 0.5, wherein the thermoelectric properties are sensitive to the Bi/Sb ratio [,]. The Bi/Sb ratio influences the carrier concentration and type of charge carriers which can tune the electrical and thermoelectric properties of BixSb2-xTe3 []. Thin films of these p-type alloys have also been studied [,] due to the possibility of their integration with integrated circuits and packages for solid-state refrigeration. Moreover, far-from-equilibrium thin film processing offers opportunities to control both electron and phonon transport [], e.g., through manipulation of grain size, preferred orientation, doping and defects. For example, adjusting the deposition temperature, or post-deposition annealing [,] offer possibilities to increase both α and σ in p-type Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 films, through grain growth, and defect chemistry changes resulting from Sb precipitation and Te depletion [].
