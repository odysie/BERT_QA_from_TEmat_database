Although the market is intensively researching on chalcogenides with multifaceted crystal structures, TEC’s in Ref. [] are fabricated by utilizing bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3)–Sb2Te3 (р-type) and Bi2Te3–Bi2Se3 (n-type), depending on the velocity of flowing gasses concerning the TAvg. Low-temperature applications of TEC’s have been designed and characterized by Akshay et al., based on Bi2Te3 nanostructures []. However, the synthesization of nanostructured Bi2Te3 and its thermoelectric properties reveal fascinating results with α = −120 μVK−1 []. Then in 2017, authors reported the synthesization of Bi2Te3 and their proposed TEC’s α was −135 μVK−1 and the observed thermal conductivity was about 0.957 W (mK)−1 []. Another group of scientists fabricated and characterized thin-film based TEC’s based on n-type nanocrystalline Bi2Te3 and results showed that the obtained Seebeck coefficient was −186.1 μVK−1 []. In Ref. [], n-type Bi2Te3 ultrathin nanowires were synthesized and providing ZT of 0.96 at 380 K. An alloy of n-type Bi2Te3 with Indium was fabricated to achieve high bandgap, aiding to suppress bipolar conduction and resulting in ZT of ∼1.1 at 625 K in 2018 []. In same year Du et al., synthesized flexible n-type tungsten composites and the obtained Seebeck coefficients vary from −11 to −12.3 μV/K at ∼300 K []. Crackless Bi2Te3 film doped with n-type impurity fabricated by electrophoretic deposition was obtained in 2018, resulting in ‘α’ of −189 μVK−1 at 500 K []. ZT about 0.83 was obtained by a sintering process of controlled oxygen content in n-type Bi2Te3 compounds at 473 K in Ref. []. Another n-type Bi2Te3 was prepared in Ref. [] by radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering and ZT of ∼0.57 at 375 K was attained. In 2018, again the thermoelectric performance of Bi2Te3 with reduced graphene oxide composite was investigated and obtained ZT (0.29) at room temperature [].
