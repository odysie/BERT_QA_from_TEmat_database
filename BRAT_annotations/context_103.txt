La, Dy, and Nb co-doped SrTiO3 powders with different Nb contents have been successfully synthesized by a high-energy ball milling method. After a graphite powder burial sintering process, the sintered bulk samples had complex structures with exterior shell and internal vesicular and high dislocation densities. Such structures produced an ultrahigh electrical conductivity of ∼5300 S cm−1 at 300 K, a low lattice thermal conductivity of ∼1.6 W m−1 K−1 from 700 to 1100 K for LaDy-Nb20, and the corresponding total thermal conductivity was 3.5 W m−1 K−1. In addition to the above complex structures, the existence of rutile TiO2 phases in the LaDy-Nb05 bulk sample further reduced the total thermal conductivity to be 2.95 W m−1 K−1. By varying the Nb content, maximum zT values of 0.28 for LaDy-Nb05 and 0.27 for LaDy-Nb20 at 1100 K were achieved. These findings suggest potential for developing the thermoelectric properties of SrTiO3 through multielement doping and complex structural designs.
