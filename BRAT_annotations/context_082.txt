Lead chalcogenides PbQ (Q = Te, Se, S) are extensively studied in virtue of their complex band structures and low thermal conductivities . Recently, significant progress has been achieved with exceptional ZT in both p- and n-type PbTe systems . The typical instance is the p-type PbTe-SrTe system, the lattice thermal conductivity can be reduced enormously by using all-scale hierarchical architectures, and a ZT value of ~ 2.2 has been achieved at 915 K for PbTe–4%SrTe doped with 2% Na . Astonishingly, a record ZT of ~ 2.5 for Pb0.98Na0.02Te-8%SrTe can be realized through non-equilibrium processing, which can give much higher solubility of SrTe (5 mol%). The heavily dissolved fraction of SrTe can enlarge the bandgap and promote the convergence of the valence bands in PbTe . For n-type PbTe system, a high ZT value of ~ 1.7 at 700 K was reported in the LAST (AgPbmSbTe2+m) , in which the exceptionally low lattice thermal conductivity stemmed from the immense phonon scattering with nanoscale precipitates .
