The n-type SnSe0.95–PbBr2 samples with orientation were synthesized by hot pressing. PbBr2 is proved an effective dopant to significantly increase the carrier concentration, and the samples show negative Seebeck coefficients in the whole temperature range. Our polycrystalline SnSe0.95–PbBr2 samples show higher thermoelectric performance in the direction perpendicular to the pressure. As a result of detailed analysis, the DOS effective mass of PbBr2-doped sample is larger than the previously reported n-type SnSe, leading to an enhanced Seebeck coefficient with electrical conductivity less affected. These effects results in a high power factor of 4.8 μW cm−1 K−2 and a ZT of 0.54 at 793 K in the SnSe0.95–3% PbBr2 systems.
