a. At high temperature (1000 K), all the Cu2−ySe0.5S0.5 compounds have a simple cubic structure, in which κL slightly decreases with rising copper vacancies. At room temperature (300 K), the κL for Cu2Se0.5S0.5 presents an opposite trend, i.e., κL increases as the copper deficiencies increase. However, these deviations in κL are very small. When considering the measurement and calculation errors, it is hard to conclude the κL is obviously changed through variation of Cu vacancies in Cu2Se0.5S0.5. Nevertheless, the κL values in Cu2Se0.5S0.5 from room temperature to high temperatures are extremely small, i.e., around 0.3–0.4 W m−1 K−1.
