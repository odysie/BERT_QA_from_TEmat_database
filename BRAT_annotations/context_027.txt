CuMn1.1−xExO2 (E=Mg, Ca, Sr, x=0–0.2) bulks with a layer structure were prepared via a solid-state reaction and sintered at 1253 K for 2.5 h in argon. The cation substitution content affected the crystalline phase and the thermoelectric properties of CuMn1.1−xExO2 (E=Mg, Ca, Sr, x=0–0.2) bulks. Bulks with the CuMnO2 phase were obtained for all samples. Increasing the amount of dopants, which were Mg, Ca and Sr, caused an expansion in unit cell volume, increase in electrical conductivity and decrease in thermal conductivity. The ionic radius of Mg is smaller than those of the other dopants, and thus it can substitute for Mn more readily. This phenomenon made the unit cell volume and electrical conductivity with Mg substitution were both higher than seen with the other dopant samples, while the thermal conductivity was lower. While the substitution effect could enhance carrier concentration, the Seebeck coefficient was inversely proportional to the carrier concentration, and this caused a fall in the absolute value of the Seebeck coefficient for all bulks. The highest electrical conductivity (0.24 S/cm) and Seebeck coefficient (485 μV/K) at room temperature were obtained from the CuMn0.9Mg0.2O2 and CuMn0.975Ca0.025O2 bulks, respectively. The κl was the major contribution to the thermal conductivity, which implies that phonon–phonon scattering had the main effect on κ for the CuMn1.1−xExO2 (E=Mg, Ca, Sr, x=0–0.2) samples. The CuMn0.9Mg0.2O2 sample had the lowest thermal conductivity (2 W m−1
K−1) and highest power factor (3.95×10−3
mW m−1
K−2), which led to a dimensionless figure of merit of 0.00059 at room temperature.
