Among the antimony telluride material family, bulk AgSbTe2 has demonstrated an extremely low lattice thermal conductivity of 0.7 Wm-1 K-1 , which has been attributed to phonon scattering with heterophases and the formation of nanoscale cation sublattices. Du et al. reached a zT of 1.4 at 550 K after doping AgSbTe2 with 2% Se. Concentrations of silver lower than the stoichiometry can produce impurities in the matrix or form precipitates, both of which are favorable to reduce the thermal conductivity. In particular, Sb2Te3/Ag2Te composites fabricated using ball milling have been found to improve the zT up to 1.5 at 700 K, and AgSbTe2/Ag2Te quenched ingots reached 1.5 at 500 K. Besides the material composition and doping, the morphology is been shown to be a key parameter in the resulting thermoelectric properties. For instance, our previous studies demonstrated a zT of 0.35 for electrodeposited Sb37Te63 films pre-annealed at 80 Â°C due to the combination of low thermal conductivity and enhanced power factor provided by a secondary phase; and nanostructured Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 achieved a zT above 1 at room temperature by inducing small grain sizes and highly dense dislocations.
