The dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit zT is displayed in c. All InxCeyCo4Sb12/InSb samples show high zT values which are largely due to a strongly suppressed lattice thermal conductivity while maintaining very good electrical transport properties. The maximum value of the dimensional figure of merit of ∼1.5 is achieved on the MS-SPS-processed In0.2Ce0.15Co4Sb12/InSb sample at 800 K. Compared with the traditional method, the application of MS-SPS technique may further enhance the zT by 15%. We also estimated zT as a function of Hall carrier concentration at 300 K based on the quality factor model by assuming a constant κL (d). Based on d, the optimum carrier concentration of the skutterudite compounds is found to be ∼1.25 × 10^20 e−/cm3. Current samples have slightly higher carrier concentrations than the optimal one. Therefore, further enhancement of the thermoelectric efficiencies is possible by tuning the charge carrier concentration in this system.
