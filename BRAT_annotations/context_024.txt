(a)-(d) show the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient of Ba24CuxGe100−x and Ba24AgyGe100−y compounds. As the doping amount increases, both the carrier concentration and the electrical conductivity decrease. As a function of temperature, the electrical conductivity decreases, displaying a metallic nature of conduction. Although the carrier mobility distinctly increases upon doping with Cu or Ag, the conductivity decreases because the reduced carrier concentration plays a more prominent role. The carrier concentration in the Ag-doped specimens is slightly lower than in the Cu-doped specimens for the same nominal doping content. This is because the actually accommodated amount of Ag in the type-III clathrate matrix phase is slightly higher than that of Cu. As the data in (c) indicate, the Seebeck coefficient is negative and in accord with the negative Hall coefficient. The single-phase Ba24Ge100 compound has the Seebeck coefficient of about −20 μV/K at room temperature and approximately −51 μV/K at 873 K. As the Cu and Ag doping content increases, the absolute value of the Seebeck coefficient increases. The magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient of Ba24Cu6Ge94 is 80.5 μV/K at 873 K while Ba24Ag6Ge94 has reached its maximum value of the Seebeck coefficient of 87 μV/K at 820 K, both Cu and Ag doped structures significantly exceeding the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient of the undoped sample.
