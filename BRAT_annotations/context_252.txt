The remarkable advantage of BiCuOSe for TE applications is its extraordinarily low lattice thermal conductivity. It is reported that the lattice thermal conductivity of non-textured BiCuOSe is as low as 0.52â€“0.9 Wm-1K-1 at 300 K,,, which is much lower than that in state of the art bulk TE materials of Bi2Te3 (1.6 Wm-1K-1 at 300 K) or PbTe (2.8 Wm-1K-1 at 300 K) and even lower than that in phonon-glass electron-crystal materials of clathrates or skutterudites. Recently, some studies on the origin of low thermal conductivity of BiCuOSe have been conducted. Pei et al. have speculated that the weak chemical bonding and strong anharmonicity of bonding resulted in the low thermal conductivity. Saha has conducted a comparison study on the lattice dynamics between BiCuOSe and LaCuOSe and ascribed the low thermal conductivity of BiCuOSe to its constituent elements with high atomic mass. However, the investigation on the phonon transport properties of BiCuOSe is still relatively rare. Recently, ab initio calculation of lattice thermal conductivity has been developed by combining the first-principles calculations of interatomic force constants with solving the phonon Boltzmann transport equation iteratively. The first-principles calculations can accurately predict the phonon thermal conductivity without any assumption on phonon lifetimes and capture the transport properties of each phonon and have been used in the investigations of phonon transport properties for many materials,,,,,,.
