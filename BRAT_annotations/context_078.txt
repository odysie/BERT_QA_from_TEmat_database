The electrical properties of MQ2 compounds usually show semiconducting behavior . MoS2 is a semiconducting material with a room temperature conductivity of 0.0012 Ω/cm and activation energy of 0.124 eV in the temperature range 150–300 K . It also shows n- and p-type Seebeck coefficient (S=−275 and 400 μV/K) and diamagnetic behavior. MoSe2 compound was reported to be n-type with the Seebeck coefficient and resistivity values being −900 μV/K and 1.0 Ω/cm at room temperature, respectively. Although the transition metal dichalcogenides MoQ2 (Q=S, Se) are a good candidate for thermoelectric applications because of their high Seebeck coefficients (S) and low thermal conductivities (k), the MQ2 show large band gap size and low electron density near Fermi level. Therefore, in order to improve thermoelectric properties of MoQ2 (Q=S and Se), it is necessary decreasing of band gap and increasing of carrier concentration near Fermi level.
