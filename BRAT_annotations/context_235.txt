We turn our attention to semi-metallic HgTe whose properties are in the transition region between semiconductors and metals. HgTe has a very high electron/hole effective mass ratio me/mh≃0.1 which results in large values of the Seebeck coefficient between -90 μV/K and -135 μV/K at room temperatures which is similar to the Seebeck coefficient of heavily doped semiconductors with a band gap. The carrier concentration of intrinsic HgTe is only 10^16–10^17 cm-3 which is much smaller than a metal or a typical good heavily-doped semiconductor thermoelectric. However, the large electron mobility in HgTe (μ 10^4 cm2/V.s) makes up for its low carrier concentration and as a result, the electrical conductivity of an intrinsic sample is relatively large and is about σ = 1700 S/cm at room temperatures. The large electron mobility is partly due to the small effective mass of the electrons and partly because of the absence of dopants. The mobility of a heavily doped semiconductor is limited by ionized impurity scattering which is not the case in an intrinsic semi-metal. The experiment reveals that intrinsic HgTe is a high power factor material with PF = 14–31 μW cm-1 K-2 at T = 300 K that is comparable to well-known thermoelectric materials such as SnSe (PF≃10 μW cm-1 K-2), PbTe1-xSex (PF≃25 μW cm-1 K-2) and Bi2Te3 (PF≃50 μW cm-1 K-2) at their zT maximum. Apart from having a good electrical transport properties, mercury telluride is a good thermal insulator with κ = 2.1 W/mK at T = 300 K. The overall zT of intrinsic single crystal without any optimization is between 0.4 to 0.5 and is comparable with most good thermoelectric materials at room temperature.
