The ZT values of all the SnS1-xSex (x = 0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8) solid solutions along the directions // and ⊥ to the SPS–pressurizing one were calculated from the combination of anisotropic electrical and thermal transport properties (Fig. 5). Over the whole temperature range, ZT// values were higher than ZT⊥, which comes mainly from the greatly suppressed thermal conductivity although power factors are lower along this direction. ZT// for SnS is 0.15 at 823 K and increases with Se content. The ZT values of all the SnS1-xSex samples increased rapidly with rising temperature and a maximum value of 0.64 at 823 K for composition SnS0.2Se0.8 was obtained along the direction // to the SPS–pressurizing direction.
