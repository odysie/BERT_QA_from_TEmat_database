Currently, the cost-effective and abundant metal sulfides and metal selenides are hot topics in the research of thermoelectric materials applied over from room temperature to moderate temperature (), and due to its high power factor and low thermal conductivity at room temperature, the silver selenide is considered to be a promising substitute for commercial Bi2Te3-based alloy (). Day et al. predicted that by reducing carrier concentration to 1.6 × 10^18 cm−3, a ZT value higher than 1 from 300 K to 600 K can be realized in Ag2+xSe (), and previous study reveals that the carrier concentration can be regulated by changing molar ratio of Ag/Se in the silver selenide samples (). For instance, Lee et al. investigated a series of samples with Ag/Se varying from 1.73 to 2.33, and it is found that the excess silver atoms promote the carrier concentration and diminish the Hall carrier mobility (). Perez-Taborda et al. demonstrated that the PF value of accurately controlled stoichiometric Ag2Se thin film on glass substrate reached up to 2440 ± 192 μW m−1 K−2 at room temperature (). Besides the non-flexible silver selenide materials, the flexible silver selenide film with outstanding performance has also been reported very recently. Cai's group published two articles about nylon-membrane-supported Ag2Se-nanowire-based flexible films in succession (), and an outstanding PF value of 2231.5 μWm−1K−2 at 300 K for flexible thermoelectric film was realized in CuAg4Se3 composite films.
