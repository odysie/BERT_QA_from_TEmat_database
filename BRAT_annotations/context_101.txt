The thermal conductivity of TmNiSb is displayed in (b). The κ value of 4.4 W K−1m−1 at room temperature is significantly smaller than those of ScNiSb and d-electron HH phases before alloying and nanostructurization: HfNiSn (6.3 W K−1m−1), ZrNiSn (8 W K−1m−1), TiNiSn (9 W K−1m−1) [], VFeSb (13 W K−1m−1) [], ZrCoBi (9 W K−1m−1) []. The sound velocity of 3214 m/s calculated for TmNiSb is similar to that of ScNiSb. The Debye-Callaway analysis yielded the parameters: U = 3.9 × 10−18 K−1 s, C = 50 K, L = 1.6 × 10−6 m, A = 9.96 × 10−42 s3, and Γ  = 0.106. The Umklapp scattering and grain boundary differ from those obtained for much lighter and less dense ScNiSb, however they are still in the range expected for HH compounds [,]. The point defect scattering parameters obtained from the refinement are comparable to pseudo-quaternary and pseudo-quintuple HH phases, while ternary HH compositions usually exhibit order of magnitude lower A and Γ [,]. Most likely explanation for the enhanced point defect scattering observed in the sample measured is strong intrinsic disorder in its crystal structure, in concert with the small value of κ at room temperature. Furthermore, the small thermal conductivity in TmNiSb complies with a rather large theoretical density of this material (9.5 g/cm3).
