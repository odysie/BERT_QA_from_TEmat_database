In conclusion, we synthesized cobaltocene-encapsulated SWNTs (CoCp2@SWNTs) and found that the material showed a high electrical conductivity (43,200 S m-1) as well as a negative Seebeck coefficient (-41.8 μV K-1) at 320 K. Due to their high electrical conductivity, the power factor of the material was much larger (75.4 μW m-1 K-2) than that of the films of empty-SWNTs (9.1 μW m-1 K-2) at 320 K. The ZT value of the CoCp2@SWNT film (0.157 at 320 K) was the highest among the reported n-type organic thermoelectric materials due to its high electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity (0.15 W m-1 K-1). The SWNT film doped with cobaltocene as an n-type dopant is a promising candidate for the next-generation thermoelectric materials due to the high electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity. We demonstrated that the developed flexible thermoelectric device that consisted of a CoCp2@SWNT film and empty SWNT film as the n- and p-doped semiconducting materials, respectively, generated voltages close to a calculated value with an excellent reversibility without any air-protective coating due to the characteristic air stability by the encapsulation. The device is quite attractive to collect a large amount of waste heat for electricity because the SWNT-based device is quite tough, flexible and has a high thermal stability.
