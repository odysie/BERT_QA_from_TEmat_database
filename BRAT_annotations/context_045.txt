Thermoelectric energy generation (TEG) might be the alternative way to solve the 21st century energy crises as this method does not require fossil-fuels and is thus environment friendly. TEG is an encouraging and effective technology for power generation and cooling. Thermoelectric materials are used to convert heat to electricity and vice-versa. The coefficient of performance of a potential thermoelectric material is determined by the dimensionless figure of merit, ZT=S2σTk, where S, σ, k=ke+kl and T are the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity (consisting of electronic and lattice thermal conductivity) and absolute temperature, respectively. The half-heusler 18-electron ABX compounds have attracted much attention due to their semiconducting behavior and high thermoelectric performance . Recently, researchers reported some previously unknown Half-Heusler compounds, such as ScPtBi, TiPdSn, ZrNbPb, etc. and it is found that ZrNiPb based half-heusler materials can exhibit high thermoelectric performance (ZT ∼ 0.8 at 800 K) . Although the pure ZrNiPb has low thermoelectric performance, the doping of suitable element (Sn, Bi) significantly increases the ZT of ZrNiPb . Recently, Zakutayev et al. reported the experimental synthesis of TaCoSn, an 18-electron ABX half-heusler compound . This material was reported to be semiconductor and possibility of high thermoelectric performance . Bhattacharya et al. calculated the optimal zT0 (not usual ZT) of TaCoSn by assuming the lattice part of thermal conductivity κph/τ ∼ 1014 W/mKs and found to be 1.73 . This indicates the possibility of high thermoelectric performance. Therefore, it is reasonable to study the lattice thermal conductivity and details of transport properties along with the electronic nature of TaCoSn.
