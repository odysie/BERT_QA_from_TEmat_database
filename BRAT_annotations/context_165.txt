Accordingly, significant efforts have been devoted to improving the mechanical properties by preparing SnSe polycrystals using hot-pressing or spark plasma sintering, however, these polycrystals typically have ZT values below 1. The low ZT values are likely due to the anisotropic TE properties of SnSe single crystals (low ZT of 0.8 along the a-axis). One way to improve ZT values is by maximizing the texturing in SnSe polycrystals during the preparation stage, where the typical sintering process would not fulfil this purpose in bulk-scale materials–,. To improve TE properties at temperatures below ~800 K, different dopants for SnSe have been explored. For example, Na doped SnSe single crystal was reported to exhibit ZT ranging from 0.7 to 2.0 at 300 K to 773 K. However, doping is less effective for SnSe polycrystals because polycrystals have less texturing and form defects easily, which can degrade the electrical properties–––.
