The Seebeck coefficients of the Magnéli phases spanned a wide range. Magnéli phases with low non-stoichiometry exhibited semiconductor behavior with increasing electrical conductivity for increasing temperature, while Magnéli phases Ti4O7 and Ti5O9 reflected metal behavior with decreasing conductivity for increasing temperature, Fig. 8. At 1,000 K, Ti4O7 reached electrical conductivities in the range of 60,000 S/m at a Seebeck coefficient of -100 μV/K. The electrical conductivity was found to increase with increasing oxygen non-stoichiometry, and power factors were dramatically improved with reduction (Figs. 8 and 9).
