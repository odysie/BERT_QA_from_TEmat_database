The general behaviour of ρ(T) CeNi2Al3 shown in Fig. 2a shows the typical nature of metallic conductivity. The estimated value of the residual resistivity ratio (RRR) defined as the room temperature resistivity divided by ρ(T → 0) is found to be 9, thus indicating the good quality of our sample. Room temperature value of ρ(T) of our compound is 50 μΩ cm and is lower than the reported 350 μΩ cm for polycrystal CeNi2Al3 sample by Sun et al.. Differences in electrical resistance and thermal conductivity are most likely due to the method in which the sample is obtained.
