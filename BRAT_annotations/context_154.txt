Under the guidance of theoretical predication, we successfully use non-toxic, non-polluting and abundant elements with stable performance to synthesize the n-type filled and doped skutterudite GaxCo4Sb12.3 and Ga0.2Co4Sb11.3Te composites. It found that Ga atoms can fill the icosahedron cages of GaxCo4Sb12.3 at high temperature but driven out of the lattice voids at low temperature to form the second phase of GaSb at grain boundaries. Te doping can suppress the bipolar effect of GaxCo4Sb12.3 effectively by increasing the carrier concentration, resulting in largely enhanced power factor and reduced thermal conductivity in Ga0.2Co4Sb11.3Te in the whole temperature range studied, especially at temperatures over 600 K. As a result, the highest ZT of 0.56 for Ga0.2Co4Sb12.3 at 573 K is greatly improved to 1.48 for Ga0.2Co4Sb11.3Te at 873 K, which is meaningful for the enhancement of thermoelectric conversion efficiency for commercial application.
