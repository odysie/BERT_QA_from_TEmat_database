. The negative sign of Seebeck coefficient for all samples over the measured temperature range indicates that predominant charge carriers for the thermoelectric transport are electrons. However, the large magnitude and non-linear temperature variation of S(T) observed in the stoichiometric compound SrAl2Si2 is strikingly different from the Y substituted alloys. The T-dependent S in SrAl2Si2 exhibits a broad minimum with an absolute value of about 100 μV/K near 130 K, and then attains a positive slope at high temperatures. The upturn of S in SrAl2Si2 at high temperatures is attributed to the contribution of thermally excited positive carriers across the pseudogap . The change in the slope for S at around 130 K suggests the existence of lighter electron and heavier hole pockets in the band structure of SrAl2Si2. However, the electrons become heavier and thus dominate the S(T) below about 100 K. Such a scenario appears to be consistent with our band structure calculations of SrAl2Si2, where the Fermi surface consists of one electron pockets centered at the M point and two hole pockets centered at the Γ point. Within the two-band model, it allows us to consider a contribution from a semiconducting like holes in addition to a metallic term as a possible explanation for the observed exotic thermoelectric transport behavior in SrAl2Si2. It should be pointed out that these interpretations are consistent with the observations in the isostructural compound CaAl2Si2 and the high-temperature result obtained from a single crystal of Sr2Al2Si2.
