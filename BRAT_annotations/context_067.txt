In conclusion, we have studied lattice vibrational modes and phonon thermal conductivity of single-layer GaGeTe using density functional perturbation theory in the local density approximation. Only one IR peak (Eu) appears at 186.9 cm−1 while two peaks of Raman modes are at 284.7 cm−1 (Eg) and 305.2 cm−1 (A1g). We have explored how the IR-active and Raman-active modes change in frequency under biaxial strains. Calculated results show that 2D GaGeTe exhibit low κL of 58 Wm−1K−1 at room temperature, significantly lower than that of graphene. In addition, our findings demonstrate the remarkable tunability of chemistry and orbital interactions with Te atoms will heavily modified phonon properties and have the chance to significantly decrease thermal conductivity. We expect that this holds certain theory support for GaGeTe-based materials for thermal related applications. Furthermore, the vibrational modes, Raman and IR spectroscopic studies, and phonon frequencies can give basic elemental information about the materials, and are also important for the fundamental theoretical understanding of many experimental characterizations.
