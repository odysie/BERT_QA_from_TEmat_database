At 230 °C, the electrical conductivity of LaCoO3 increased dramatically compared to the other deposited films. For instance, at 430 °C, the electrical conductivity of LaCoO3 is about two orders of magnitude larger than that of LaFeO3 and one order of magnitude larger than that of LaCrO3. This trend is in agreement with that reported in literature for bulk ceramics with the similar compositions . The electrical conductivity of LaFeO3 at 560 °C was measured to be 0.39S cm−1, which is close to the value of 0.36S cm−1 for bulk LaFeO3 reported by Hung et al. . LaMnO3 presents a conductivity of 4.80S cm−1at 560 °C, which is close to ∼5.5 S cm−1 reported by Fujihira et al. for films prepared on Al2O3 substrates using the sol–gel method. The electrical conductivity mechanism of LaMO3 (M=Cr, Co, Fe and Mn) perovskite oxides has been discussed by several authors. It is largely accepted in the literature that the charge transfer occurs via the M–O–M bonds due to the exchange of the electronic state of the transition metal between M+4 and M+3. It is worth noting that the transition metal (M) in LaMO3 perovskites is present in the M+3 oxidation state.
