where α, T, κl, μ, n, and e are, respectively, the Seebeck coefficient, absolute mean temperature, lattice thermal conductivity, carrier mobility, carrier density and electron charge. Here, L is defined as the Lorenz number equal to 2.44 × 10^-8 WΩ K-2. This formula has recently been redefined to solve the inconsistence between theoretical predication and experimental measurement. Before the 1990s, the progress of improving ZT had been slow and the best TE material was Bi2Te3 alloys with ZT ≈ 1.0 at 300 K. To increase ZT, many new approaches have been proposed, such as fabricating low-dimensional thermoelectric structures to increase large density of state, engineering the interface of materials to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity, and modulating dopants to increase carrier mobility. Subsequently, further improvements include ZT = 2.4 at 300 K for p-type Bi2Te3/Sb2Te3 superlattice, and ZT = 3 at 550 K for Bi-doped n-type PbSeTe/PbTe quantum-dot superlattice. A prospective of nanostructured TE materials can be found in a review paper. For practical applications, other issue such as size, maintenance and fast response time must also be considered even if high-efficiency TE materials are found ref..
