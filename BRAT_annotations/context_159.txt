 shows the variation of S with temperature, as a function of the TiC nanoparticles addition. The graph clearly shows that S is positive at all temperatures, confirming a conduction mechanism mainly produced by holes. The values of the Seebeck coefficient increase with temperature, and display the same vales for all the samples. This behaviour can be explained when considering the very small contribution of TiC to the S values of these samples . Consequently, the total S values, which have been measured in these samples are only due to the Ca3Co4O9 contribution, and it is the same for all of them. The highest S value has been determined at 800 °C (around 195 μV/K) is higher than the best values reported for pure Ca3Co4O9 samples sintered and textured by spark plasma sintering (170–175 μV/K) . On the other hand, it is lower than the measured in highly dense materials prepared through alternative methods (205 μV/K) .
