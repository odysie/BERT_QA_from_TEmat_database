In summary, the substitution of Ge by Bi in GeTe enables an exquisite manipulation of carrier concentration n, Fermi level EF and thermal conductivity κ to optimum values that raise the zT of Bi-doped Ge1-xBixTe specimens for x = 0–0.12. The combination of theoretical calculations and experimental results elucidates the interrelations between σ, S and band valleys. Due to the substantial reduction in κ, the zT of all Bi doped Ge1-xBixTe specimens are greatly enhanced. A remarkable zT of 1.91 at 740 K is achieved in the specimen of Ge0.9Bi0.1Te, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art high performance thermoelectric material systems.
