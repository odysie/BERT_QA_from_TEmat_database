Reported lattice thermal conductivities,κL at room temperature in CaAl2Si2-type TE compounds span a relatively wide range from ~0.6 W m-1 K-1 in CaCd2Sb2 to ~4.5 W m-1 K-1 in CaMg2Sb2. Among them, Mg3Sb2 with a low density of ~4.0 g cm-3 shows an intrinsically low room-temperature κL of about 1.0–1.5 W m-1 K-1,, comparable to those of the state-of-the-art TE materials PbTe and Bi2Te3., A small difference (~15%) in κL is found between single crystalline and polycrystalline Mg3Sb2 samples,, suggesting that the grain boundary scattering does not play a significant role in phonon transport. Though alloying is often applied to further reducing lattice thermal conductivity through point defect scattering, the intrinsically low thermal conductivity induced by the phonon–phonon scattering is indispensable to the exceptionally high zT in n-type Mg3Sb2-based materials. Below we will discuss the origin of the intrinsically low lattice thermal conductivity in Mg3Sb2 from first principles.
