The anisotropic thermoelectric properties along a, b and c axes of Bi-doped SnSe with carrier concentration of 2.1 × 10^19 cm-3 were shown in Fig. 5. Anisotropic thermoelectric properties were clearly exhibited. Indeed, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity along b and c axes are much larger than those along a axis, while Seebeck coefficient along a axis is slightly larger. So we observed maximum PF along b and c axes are 11.98 and 10.36 μWcm-1 K-2, while that along a axis is 4.29 μWcm-1 K-2. Temperature-dependent ZT along a, b and c axes are shown in Fig. 6. Highest ZT value of 2.2 was observed along b axis at about 733 K, while those along c and a axes are 2.1 and 0.8, respectively. This result is comparable to ZT=2.6 at 923 K for the reported p-type SnSe, indicating that both n- and p-type SnSe exhibit excellent thermoelectric properties, as predicted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The anisotropic trend is similar with p-type SnSe. However, the optimum temperature is 773 K in Bi-doped SnSe, whereas 923 K in p-type SnSe.
