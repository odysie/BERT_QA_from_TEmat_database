The single crystal used in the present study was prepared by using the Bridgman technique. The detailed sample preparation method can be found in ref. . A thin flake was fabricated from a single crystal of Mn3Sn using a focused ion-beam system. The final processing of Ga+ ion milling was performed by a low acceleration voltage of 5 kV to reduce the damaged layer at the surface. The polished thin single crystal flake was then transferred to a thermally oxidized Si substrate by using a W needle manipulator. Then, the surface of Mn3Sn was milled by Ar dry etching to remove the residual damaged layer. The MgO/NiFe and Cu electrodes were formed by electron beam lithography and lift-off processes. The edge of the Mn3Sn flake was covered by a 30-nm-thick Al2O3 layer to avoid direct contact between the sample edge and the electrodes. The resistivity of the processed Mn3Sn crystal was 360 μΩ cm at room temperature, which is comparable to the bulk value. In addition, the metallic behaviour of the temperature dependence of the resistivity was confirmed. The MgO insertion layer was prepared by a method similar to that used in a previous study. Thus, the interfacial resistance is expected to be about 0.1 Ω μm2.
