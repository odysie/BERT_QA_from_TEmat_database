Figure 2 shows the temperature-dependent electrical conductivity (a), Seebeck coefficient (b), power factor (c), thermal diffusivity (d), total thermal conductivity (e), and lattice thermal conductivity (f) for Mg3-xLixSb2 samples. The room temperature electrical conductivity is only ~ 0.08 × 10^4 S m-1 for undoped Mg3Sb2, lower than that reported by Song et al., but higher than that reported by Bhardwaj et al.. This difference might be related to the different concentration of Mg vacancy induced by the different synthesis conditions. Li doping increased the electrical conductivity because of the increased carrier concentration (see Fig. 3a). With increasing content of Li, the electrical conductivity first increased, and then decreased at x 0.006, indicating the lower doping limit (~ 0.6 atm.%) of Li in [Mg2Sb2]2- electronic framework, consistent with the room temperature carrier concentration dependence of x shown in Fig. 3a. The highest room temperature Hall carrier concentration is ~ 3 × 10^19 cm-3 for Mg2.994Li0.006Sb2, higher than the optimized Ag-doped Mg3Sb2 (~ 1 × 10^19 cm-3), but lower than the optimized Na-doped Mg3Sb2 (~ 8 × 10^19 cm-3). The existence of impurity Sb led to the abnormally increased carrier concentration and electrical conductivity in Mg2.965Li0.035Sb2. With increasing temperature, the electrical conductivity presented a metallic behavior in Mg2.994Li0.006Sb2, and changed to a semiconducting behavior in Mg2.975Li0.025Sb2 due to the decreased carrier concentration. The Seebeck coefficient of the undoped Mg3Sb2 is positive in the whole measured temperature range (Fig. 2b), consistent with the Hall measurement. Li doping decreased the Seebeck coefficient from ~ 336 to ~ 142 μV K-1. However, with the increased electrical conductivity, the maximum power factor (PF = σS2) increased dramatically from ~ 2 μW cm-1 K-2 at about 773 K for undoped Mg3Sb2 to ~ 6 μW cm-1 K-2 at about 773 K for Mg2.975Li0.025Sb2 (Fig. 2c), higher than those of Ag-doped Mg3Sb2 (~ 5 μW cm-1 K-2) and Pb-doped Mg3Sb2 (~ 3 μW cm-1 K-2).
