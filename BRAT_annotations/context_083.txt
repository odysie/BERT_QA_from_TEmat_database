Apparently, PbTe-based materials are one of the state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials. However, the reserve of the elemental Te is rare in the Earth's crust . Therefore, it is significant to explore less expensive and more earth abundant elements to substitute Te . PbSe can be a potential alternative due to its attractive features, such as higher melting point and higher thermal stability compared with PbTe . Recently, p-type PbSe has been widely studied and high performance has been achieved due to its complex band structures . A high ZT of ~ 1.6 at 923â€¯K can be achieved for p-type PbSe alloying with 3% Cd through using the panoscopic approach . However, few reports on n-type PbSe, which is urgent to be developed to match its high-performance p-type counterpart .
