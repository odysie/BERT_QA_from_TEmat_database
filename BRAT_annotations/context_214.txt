Abstract:
The typical conductive polymer of PEDOT:PSS has recently attracted intensive attention in thermoelectric conversion because of its low cost and low thermal conductivity as well as high electrical conductivity. However, compared to inorganic counterparts, the relatively poor thermoelectric performance of PEDOT:PSS has greatly limited its development and high-tech applications. Here, we report a dramatic enhancement in the thermoelectric performance of PEDOT:PSS by constructing unique composite films with graphene quantum dots (GQDs). At room temperature, the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of PEDOT:PSS/GQDs reached to 7172 S/m and 14.6 Î¼V/K, respectively, which are 30.99% and 113.2% higher than those of pristine PEDOT:PSS. As a result, the power factor of the optimized PEDOT:PSS/GQDs composite is 550% higher than that of pristine PEDOT:PSS. These significant improvements are attributed to the ordered alignment of PEDOT chains on the surface of GQDs, originated from the strong interfacial interaction between PEDOT:PSS and GQDs and the separation of PEDOT and PSS phases. This study evidently provides a promising route for PEDOT:PSS applied in high-efficiency thermoelectric conversion.
