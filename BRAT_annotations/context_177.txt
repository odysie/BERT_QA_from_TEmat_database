Figure 5(a) illustrates the temperature dependence of σ for the SnxCu1.8-xS (x = 0.005–0.05) bulk material. For the pure Cu1.8S sample, the σ was initially 3560 S/cm and decreased to 1220 S/cm with increasing temperature, showing a turning point of the σ. The appearance of the turning point at 373 K for the pure Cu1.8S, which was sintered at 773 K, can be explained by the phase change, where Cu ion positions were changed. For the Sn0.03Cu1.77S and Sn0.05Cu1.75S samples, the values of the σ were initially 401 S/cm and 405 S/cm, respectively, due to the main phase of them is Cu1.8S (as shown in Fig. 1), the temperature dependences of the transport behavior is similar to the pure Cu1.8S sample. However, because of the second phase and nano pores scattering the value of the samples x = 0.03 and x = 0.05 are much lower than that of pure Cu1.8S sample. The σ decreased to 33–74 S/cm, 19–96 S/cm in the whole temperature range for the x = 0.005, 0.01, respectively, due to the main phase of them is Cu1.96S (as shown in Fig. 1), the temperature dependences of the transport behavior are similar with the pure Cu1.96S sample. The two samples x = 0.03 and x = 0.05 have a relatively high σ due to the high electrical impurities of Cu1.8S and Cu4SnS4. Cu4SnS4 is a p-type semiconductor with an σ of 70 S/cm at room temperature. The x = 0.01 sample got the lowest electrical conductivity (19 S/cm) because of the low σ of Cu1.96S matrix and the second phase of Cu2SnS3. Cu2SnS3 has been reported as a solar energy material with an σ of 0.5 S/cm. Table I shows carrier concentration and carrier mobility of all SnxCu1.8-xS bulk samples at room temperature. With the increasing Sn concentration, the carrier concentration of the bulk samples decreased due to increased impure contents. However, the mobility of the samples linearly increases with increasing Sn contents due to the increased Cu vacancies. In this work, we supposed that the Sn will occupy the Cu site, the Cu content was therefore reduced when preparing the sample. But the Sn become the second phases and leaving the increased Cu vacancies with increasing Sn content. Cu1.8S is a kind of superionic conductor in which Cu ions have a large mobility in the lattice as in liquid electrolytes and the main carrier is
