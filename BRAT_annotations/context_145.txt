It crystalizes in the orthorhombic structure with the space group 61 (Pbca), having a band gap around 0.75 eV and a relatively high Seebeck coefficient at intermediate temperatures range. However, the thermoelectric property of pristine CoSbS is very low due to its low carrier concentration (n ~ 10^17 cm−3) and relatively high thermal conductivity (9.59 W m−1 K−1) . In the past several years, most investigations have focused on optimizing the carrier concentration of the material by doping with Ni, Zn and Se to improve its thermoelectric performance. Our previous investigation shows that Se doping on the S site modified the electronic band configuration where it shrinks the band gap and decreases the activation energy of the impurity states. Additionally, Z. Liu et al. doped Ni on the Co site of CoSbS increasing the carrier concentration. As a result, large power factor of 20 μW cm−1 K−2 at 873 K is attained in Ni doped Co1-xNixSbS. However, due to the enhanced magnetic scattering, the carrier mobility sharply decreases upon Ni doping. Therefore exploring some nonmagnetic dopant in CoSbS is urgent for further improvement of the thermoelectric properties of CoSbS.
