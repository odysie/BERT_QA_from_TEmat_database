The conductivity of the Na0.2Cu1.8S compound at room temperature turned out to be the largest among the studied compositions and amounted to about 800 S cm-1. Na0.05Cu1.95S and Na0.15Cu1.85S samples demonstrate a low conductivity of about 60 S cm-1 at ambient temperature. The temperature dependences of the electronic conductivity of the investigated Na0.05Cu1.95S, Na0.1Cu1.9S, Na0.15Cu1.85S, and Na0.2Cu1.8S compounds in the range from 20 to 450 °C demonstrate several extrema. The anomalies near 90 and 100 °C obviously are caused by the phase transitions in chalcocite and djurleite phases. The deep minima of the conductivity near 350–400 °C perhaps reflects the phase transition to the superionic cubic phase. In stoichiometric Cu2S, the phase transition occurs at 435 °C, but in the NaхCu2 - хS compounds the copper deficit shifts the phase transition point to lower temperatures obviously.
