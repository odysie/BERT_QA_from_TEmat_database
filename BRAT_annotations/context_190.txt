Optimization of the thermoelectric performance of TaFeSb-based half-Heuslers was realized by tuning the carrier concentration via Ti-doping. In our work, Ta1-xTixFeSb (x = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.10, 0.12, 0.14, 0.16, and 0.18) samples were prepared by the ball-milling and hot-pressing method. All of the samples are highly dense with an average grain size of ~250 nm (as shown in Supplementary Fig.) and they are single-phase with high crystallinity (as shown in Supplementary Fig.). For simplicity, the thermoelectric properties of only some of the Ta1-xTixFeSb specimens are shown in Fig. 3, while the complete results can be found in Supplementary Fig.. As shown in Fig. 3a, the electrical conductivity of the pristine TaFeSb is very low but it increases markedly with Ti-doping. Enhancement of the electrical conductivity should be attributed to the substantially increased hole concentration, as shown in Supplementary Fig.. It is ~5.26 × 10^20 cm-3 for Ta0.98Ti0.02FeSb and ~2.03 × 10^21 cm-3 for Ta0.84Ti0.16FeSb. This indicates that Ti is a very efficient dopant for supplying a high concentration of holes to TaFeSb, which is similar to the case of Ti-doping in NbFeSb. Due to the increased hole concentration, the Seebeck coefficient of Ta1-xTixFeSb (with the exception of TaFeSb) is reduced gradually with increasing Ti concentration, as shown in Fig. 3b. It should be noted that the undoped TaFeSb is fully p-type over the whole temperature range and its Seebeck coefficient increases with temperature without showing any bipolar conduction despite its low hole concentration. This should be ascribed to the relatively large band gap of ~0.53 eV for TaFeSb, which is even larger than that of NbFeSb (~0.41 eV), as shown in Supplementary Fig.. Optimization of the holeconcentration substantially improves the power factor of TaFeSb-based half-Heuslers, as shown in Fig. 3c. The room-temperature power factor is ~45 μW cm-1 K-2 for Ta0.84Ti0.16FeSb and its peak power factor can be as large as ~56 μW cm-1K-2, thus leading to its high average power factor of ~52 μW cm-1K-2 in the temperature range between 300 and 973 K. Such a high power factor outperforms most of the other state-of-the-art half-Heusler compounds, e.g., (Ti/Zr/Hf)CoSb, (Ti/Zr/Hf)NiSn, ZrNiPb, and NbCoSn. The origin of the high electronic thermoelectric performance of TaFeSb-based half-Heuslers can be partially ascribed to the unique electronic band structure, as shown in Fig. 3d. The valence band maximum locates at the L-point (with a carrier pocket degeneracy of four), where
