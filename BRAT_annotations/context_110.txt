Symmetry reduction in the crystal structure generally splits the electronic bands according to the degree of symmetry reduction. The electronic transport can be enhanced significantly via proper crystal-structure engineering if many split bands with slightly different energy converge together to result in high valley degeneracy, which is even sometimes better than that of the high-symmetry structure. The symmetry reduction can simultaneously reduce the lattice thermal conductivity. In Joule, Pei and co-workers showed a high zT of ∼2.4 at 600 K in rhombohedral GeTe, which is significantly higher than the previously reported cubic analog of GeTe (B). Practical application demands high zT throughout the measured temperature range, which is governed by the device figure of merit (ZT). Rhombohedral GeTe showed a record-high device ZT of 1.5 in the temperature range of 300–800 K. Significantly high zTmax and ZT values in rhombohedral Bi- and Pb-doped GeTe can be attributed to slight symmetry breaking of the crystal structure, which synergistically improves the electronic transport properties via convergence of the split valence bands and reduces the lattice thermal conductivity. Thus, an optimized low-symmetry solid will be an important candidate for next-generation thermoelectrics, which expands the possibility of a search for a new inorganic solid stabilized in a slightly low-symmetry structure.
