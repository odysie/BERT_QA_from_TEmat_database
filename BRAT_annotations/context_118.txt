On the other hand, oxides have recently been exploited as alternative thermoelectric materials. Because oxides have the merits of long-time use in air at high temperature, they would possibly be regarded as promising thermoelectric materials due to their potential to thermoelectric power generation by waste heat . In general, the thermoelectric performance of oxide compounds is always believed to be much lower than that of the semiconductor alloys. However, Terasaki et al. have recently reported a high Seebeck coefficient (100 μV/K at 300 K) and a low resistivity (200 μΩ cm at 300 K) for NaCo2O4 single crystal. These data indicate that some semiconducting oxides may be possible for thermoelectric applications. Because of the volatility of sodium above 1073 K and hygroscopicity of NaCo2O4 in air, its practical application is quite limited. So, it is necessary to find new stable oxide systems with good thermoelectric properties.
