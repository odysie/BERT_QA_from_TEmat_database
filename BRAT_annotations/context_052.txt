b shows the temperature dependence of the power factor of Mn1-xCuxTe (x = 0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075) samples. Typically, at room temperature, the power factor value for MnTe is 64.8 μW m−1 K−2, which increases to a maximum of 431.7 μW m−1K−2 at 773 K. With the increase of the Cu content, the power factor decreases from 64.8 μW m−1 K−2 for the pristine MnTe to 18.4 μW m−1 K−2 for Mn0.925Cu0.075Te at room temperature, mainly due to the great decrease of the Seebeck coefficient. After 500 K, the power factor values for the doped samples exceed that of the pristine MnTe because of the increased electrical conductivity, then reach a maximum at 773 K. The power factor of Mn0.925Cu0.075Te becomes the maximum of 584.2 μW m−1K−2 at 773 K due to the decrease of the electrical resistivity and the relative high Seebeck coefficient at elevated temperature, which is 35.3% greater than that of the un-doped MnTe sample.
