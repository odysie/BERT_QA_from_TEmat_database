(a)–(f), respectively. The resistivity ρ of samples increase with the rise of the temperature, suggesting semiconductor behaviors ((a)). With the increase of Ag content in the sample, the resistivity ρ is greatly reduced compared with the Mg3Sb2 pure phase due to the increase of carrier concentration and mobility, which is consistent with the changes in . A minimum resistivity of 3.5 × 10−5 Ω m was obtained at 773 K in Mg2.96Ag0.04Sb2. The Seebeck coefficient is positive ((b)), in according with the Hall coefficient. The result shows that the Mg3-xAgxSb2 samples all exhibit p type conduction, and the hole is the main mode of conduction. The samples show a downward trend in the measured temperature range, revealing that the carrier concentration is lower at room temperature. As the temperature increases, the thermal excitation increases and the electrons are more likely to transition from the valence band to the conduction band, resulting in an increase in carrier concentration. Under the combined action of carrier concentration and mobility, the Seebeck coefficient decreased significantly with the increase of Ag content (). The power factor of Mg3-xAgxSb2 is calculated by the equation PF = α2/ρ and the results are presented in (c). The samples show the PF value is significantly enhanced with the increase of Ag content. The maximum power factor 5.21 × 10−4 W/m·K2 is obtained for x = 0.04 at 723 K, which is 3 times higher than that for pristine Mg3Sb2 (1.42 × 10−4W/m·K2). In this paper, the power factor of Mg1.96Ag0.04Sb2 is 5.21 × 10−4 W/m·K2 at 773 K, which is higher than 4.6 × 10−4 W/m·K2 of Mg1.985Ag0.015Sb2 in the literature, probably due to the resistivity of the latter sample is not the lowest since the XRD shows that there is still some unreacted Sb at x = 0.015 [], resulting in some bad electrical properties.
