The thermoelectric properties of niobium oxide ceramics were systematically explored. All niobium oxides were n-type conductors. NbO was an excellent conductor with more than 200,000 S/m, a Seebeck coefficient of 25 μV/K and high lattice conductivity of 8 W/mK (1,000 K). NbO2 ceramics showed lower electrical conductivity, 15,000 S/m, Seebeck coefficient of 150 μV/K and lattice conductivity of 3 W/mK (1,000 K). Pure Nb2O5 materials exhibited the low electrical conductivity of an insulator (2,600 S/m at 1,000 K) with Seebeck coefficient (220 μV/K), so that reduction was needed to achieve good thermoelectric performance. The beneficial effect of CS defects in Nb2O5 was immediately apparent in its low lattice conductivity, which was without further optimization in the order of 2 W/mK.
