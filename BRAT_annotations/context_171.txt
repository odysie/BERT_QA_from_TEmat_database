The dependence of ZT as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 5c. The ZT along ab direction is evidently exceeds that along c direction due to the higher electrical conductivity. The maximum figure of merit (ZT) of 0.35 is obtained for BiTeBr specimen at 560 K. It is possible to reach a higher peak ZT if the measurement temperature is increased further. However, given the possible thermal instability, this does not extend to higher temperatures. Although Cl alloying in BiTeBr lowers the thermal conductivity, it results in a deterioration in the electrical properties and does not contribute to improving the TE performance. To further enhance ZT of BiTeBr, reducing the carrier concentration to further enhance the power factor is a promising way. Furthermore, isoelectronic alloying by using Sb could be another effective way to suppress the lattice thermal conductivity and thus improve the TE performance.
