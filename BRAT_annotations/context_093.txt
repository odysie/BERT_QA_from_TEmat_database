Anatase, rutile, and brookite are three most common polymorphs of TiO2. Of these, rutile is a stable phase under the ambient conditions, while both brookite and anatase are metastable . Due to the tunable semiconducting properties and the large Seebeck coefficient, titanium dioxide displays tantalizing thermoelectric behavior. For titanium dioxide, the change of stoichiometry is viable in a relatively wide range, ranging from TiO to TiO2. TinO2n-1, which is known as Magnèli phase, has been explored as a potential thermoelectric material. Substoichiometric TinO2n-1 is formed when reducing happens to titanium dioxide, and the so-called crystallographic shear structures, in which dense planar defects are regularly introduced in the mother rutile structure, is evolved . Over the past decades, some groups have reported their efforts in improving zT value of titanium oxide and great progress has been made. A high zT value of 1.64 obtained in TiO1.1 has been reported , but verifications for it are needed . He et al. fabricated nonstoichiometric TiO2-x by oxidizing TiO and the following direct current induced hot press, with the highest zT being about 0.2–0.23 . And through the solid phase reaction of TiO2 and TiN, zT value of the resultant sample mainly consisting of Ti7O13 reached 0.4 (at 1150 K) . Many other efforts have also been focused on exploiting the thermoelectric property of TiO2-x. The precursory studies show that the thermoelectric performance of titanium oxide strongly depends on the preparation conditions, particle size and microstructure. The low electrical conductivity and the high thermal conductivity are two chief obstacles to the good thermoelectric performance of titanium oxide. Current methods of preparing thermoelectrics involve tedious steps, leading to the cost and complexity, compromising the reproducibility of the materials.
