The thermal conductivities of the rare-earth-containing samples remain below 1.2 W m−1 K−1, whereas pristine Ba8Cu16P30 exhibits a higher thermal conductivity of 1.4 W m−1 K−1 at room temperature. This is a result of the diminishing contribution of the charge carrier component (C). The trend reverses for the lattice contribution to the total thermal conductivity, such that the most complex structure, pristine orthorhombic Ba8Cu16P30, exhibits the lowest lattice thermal conductivity; the less complex tetragonal Ba6.4La1.6Cu16P30 with smaller cages and less space for guest rattling possesses higher lattice thermal conductivity. Nonetheless, the total and lattice thermal conductivities for all the clathrates studied are very low and comparable with those for state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials. Rare-earth incorporation leads to enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient and suppression of the total thermal conductivity, resulting in a significant improvement of the thermoelectric figure of merit, zT = S2T/ρκ, where S is the thermopower, T is the absolute temperature, ρ is the electrical resistivity, and κ is the total thermal conductivity. Ba6.4La1.6Cu16P30 shows the highest efficiency, 0.11 at 300 K to 0.63 at 900 K, compared with the poor efficiency of Ba8Cu16P30, 0.01 at 300 K to 0.09 at 900 K; 700% enhancement of thermoelectric efficiency due to rare-earth doping is a substantial achievement compared with incremental 20%–40% increases that are typical in the thermoelectric field. Moreover, the flexible Cu–P clathrate framework provides room for further improvement of the thermoelectric efficiency.
