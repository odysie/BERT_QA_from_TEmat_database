The power factors of the Ca3−xYxCo4O9+δ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.3) fabricated using sol−gel processed powders are calculated from the obtained σ and α values, as shown in (d). The power factors of all samples increase with the increase in temperature, indicating high thermal stability at elevated temperatures. Among the studied samples, Ca2.7Y0.3Co4O9+δ shows the largest power factor (3.05 × 10−4 W m−1 K−2) at 1073 K because of the largest Seebeck coefficient. This result indicates that the substitution of Y3+ is highly effective in improving the electrical transport properties of Ca3Co4O9. Furthermore, the power factors of the Ca3−xYxCo4O9+δ fabricated using sol−gel processed powders are larger than those fabricated using commercial powders (Supplementary Fig. S1(c)). The power factors of the Ca3−xYxCo4O9+δ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.3) fabricated using commercial powders range from 1.2 × 10−4 to 1.6 × 10−4 W m−1 K−2 at 773 K and from 2.1 × 10−4 to 2.73 × 10−4 W m−1 K−2 at 1073 K.
