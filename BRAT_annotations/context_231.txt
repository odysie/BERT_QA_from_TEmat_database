We computed the electronic transport coefficients Seebeck coefficient (S), electronic conductivity (σ), electronic thermal conductivity (κ), power factor (S2σ) and the electronic ZT (S2σTκ) for pristine and doped Cu2Te at 300 K from the distribution of modes. Figure S2(a) shows the electronic conductivities of Cu2Te, Cu1.99Ga0.01Te, Cu1.97Ga0.03Te and Cu1.95Ga0.05Te. It was observed that the electronic conductivities increased significantly with the increase in doping content of Ga (Fig. 3c). There were a lot of intrinsic vacancies in Cu2-xTe, which were substituted by the Ga3+ n-type donor contributed three electrons to the system leading to the initiation of the large number of free electrons, particularly near the conduction band maxima (CBM). The peak electronic conductivity of 2.75 × 10^6 S/m was achieved in case of Cu1.95Ga0.05Te in the vicinity of VBM, the magnitudes of σ decreased in the CB compared to the valence band and exhibited the highest depletion near the Fermi level due to the absence of charge carriers. The highest enhancement factor in electronic conductivity was around 7 for Cu1.95Ga0.05Te, as shown in Fig. 3c. The same trend of variation of electronic conductivity was also observed in the case of, Cu1.99Ga0.01Te, and Cu1.97Ga0.03Te with conductivities increasing with the Ga content. The Seebeck coefficients, however, did not exhibit an increasing trend with increasing electron concentration as a result of doping (Fig. S2b). The composition Cu1.99Ga0.01Te showed the maximum Seebeck coefficient value of S = 365 μV/K in the energy range -9 to -8 eV (please refer to Fig. S2b), much higher than the peak S value of pristine Cu2Te at 745 K (50 μV/K). Maximum values of positive Seebeck coefficients were obtained in the same energy -9 to -8 eV for all the other compositions, with Cu1.95Ga0.05Te exhibiting the second highest Speak value of 310 μV/K, followed by Cu2Te (Speak = 255 μV/K) and Cu1.97Ga0.03Te (Speak = 240 μV/K). Compared to pristine Cu2Te, the highest enhancement factor of ~58 in Seebeck coefficient was observed in Cu1.99Ga0.01Te followed by 40 times enhancement in Cu1.97Ga0.03Te (Fig. 3b).Thus the enhancement in Seebeck coefficients did not occur as a function of increasing Ga concentration unlike the electronic conductivity, such behavior may be attributed due to the trade-off between S and σ to maximize the power factor.
