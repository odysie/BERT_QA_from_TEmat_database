(b) presents the Seebeck coefficients as function of temperature for polycrystalline SnS1-xBrx (x = 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04). When Br doping content (x) increased to 0.02, the Seebeck coefficients are negative in the whole measurement temperature range, which clearly show that Br is an effective electron dopant to realize n-type conducting SnS. It is readily seen that the n-type SnS samples possess large absolute Seebeck coefficients due to low carrier concentration, namely, the Seebeck coefficient of SnS0.98Br0.02 can reach as large as - 640 μV K−1 at 823 K. (c) demonstrates the power factor (PF=S2σ) of polycrystalline SnS1-xBrx increases with rising temperature due to the enhanced electrical conductivity, the SnS0.98Br0.02 sample exhibits the highest power factor of ~1.2 μW cm−1 K−2 at 823 K.
