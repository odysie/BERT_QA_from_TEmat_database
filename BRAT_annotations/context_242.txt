Now we turn to the computation of lattice thermal conductivity κl. As mentioned above, we estimate κl by means of the phonon Boltzmann transport equation and DFT as implemented in VASP and ShengBTE code. As presented by the fitted lines in Fig. 5, κl decreases following a T-1 dependence with the increasing temperature, suggesting that Umklapp phonon scattering dominates three-phonon interactions. From the calculations, the obtained lattice thermal conductivity of monolayer PdSe2 is 3.7 (1.4) and 7.2 (2.7) Wm-1 K-1 at 300 K (800 K) along the x and y directions, respectively, which are much lower than MoS2 and GX2 monolayers. It is obvious that the lattice thermal conductivity exhibits large directional anisotropy which may be due to differences in group velocity, anharmonicity and scattering phase space along the different directions.
