(e) and (f) show the temperature dependence of ZT. The maximum ZT of Ga0.2Co4Sb12.3 sample is about 0.56 at 623 K, which is over three times that of CoSb3 around the same temperature [] and is also three times that of Ga0.25Co4Sb12 prepared by conventional quenching method []. Benefiting from the increased power factor and the decreased thermal conductivity, the Ga0.2Co4Sb11.3Te sample exhibits superior thermoelectric performance than the Ga0.2Co4Sb12.3 sample in the whole temperature range studied. Since the increased Eg () and carrier concentration suppress the bipolar effect of the Ga0.2Co4Sb12.3 sample at 573 K, it is obvious that the temperature corresponding to the maximum ZT shifts gradually from lower to higher temperature between Ga0.2Co4Sb12.3 and Ga0.2Co4Sb11.3Te. And the maximum ZT of 1.48 is achieved for the Ga0.2Co4Sb11.3Te sample at 873 K, which is almost three times that of Ga0.2Co4Sb12.3. This value is also higher than that of other CoSb3-based skutterudites with single/multiple element doping, as shown in
