(a), while PN2 had a Pt NW positioned diagonally on the MEMS pattern, as shown in the inset of (b). For PN1, there was a weak correlation between the Seebeck coefficient and the nanoheater generating the temperature gradient due to the symmetric configuration. On the other hand, the Seebeck coefficient of PN2 varied significantly depending upon which nanoheater was used. This was attributed to the highly asymmetric configuration of PN2. (b) shows that, after temperature correction with the simulation results, the ΔV/ΔT values nearly converged, thus validating the temperature-correction scheme. The Seebeck coefficient for the Pt NW on the Pt/Ti electrode system was determined to be −1.8 μV/K at 300 K from the corrected data.
