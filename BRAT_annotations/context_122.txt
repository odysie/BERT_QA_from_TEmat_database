. σxx(T) was measured under different magnetic fields in the temperature range of 5–300K. Electrical conductivity increases with increase in temperature, indicating a nonmetallic conduction. σxx(T) = 2980 and 3000 S/cm were obtained at 300K under the fields of 0 and 50 kOe, respectively. The conductivity value at 300K was found to be slightly higher than that observed for Mn2CoAl (i.e. 2440 S/cm) reported
