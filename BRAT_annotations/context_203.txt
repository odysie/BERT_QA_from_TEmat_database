The thermal conductivity is measured at room temperature and values are presented in Table 2. Total thermal conductivity (κtotal) can be expressed as κtotal = κel + κph, where κel and κph represent the electronic and lattice thermal conductivity, respectively. κel can be calculated by using the Wiedemann–Franz–Lorenz relationship, κel = LσT, where L = π2k2/3e2 = 2.45 × 10^-8 W Ω K-2 is the Lorenz number and T is the absolute temperature. κph is obtained by subtracting κel from κtotal. It can be clearly seen from Table 2 that the total thermal conductivity for all the doped samples is less than that of CaMnO3-δ 1 Ω-cm, κel is negligible. But in our case, the resistivity is lower than 1 Ω-cm, a fact which leads us to determine the κel by using the Wiedemann-Franz law. The calculated value of κel, for CaMnO3-δ is 0.019 W m-1 K-1 and (Ca0.95Bi0.05MnO3-δ) is 0.11 W m-1 K-1 at 700 K, respectively. For all the samples, the lattice contribution is more important than the electronic one. Due to the small κel, κtotal is mainly attributed to the lattice contribution. The κtotal of Ca0.95Bi0.05MnO3-δ is about 1.91 W m-1 K-1 at 300 K. It should be emphasized that in contrast to the CaMnO3-δ the Ca0.95Bi0.05MnO3-δ samples show much lower κtotal. The κtotal of the doped sample (x = 0.05) is lower than the reported values of Bi doped CaMnO3 samples. Ohtaki et al. and Xu et al. have reported that κtotal: 3.0 W m-1 K-1 at 300 K for Ca0.9Bi0.1MnO3, 3.6 W m-1 K-1 at 300 K for Ca0.96Bi0.04MnO3, respectively. This suggests that partial substitution of Bi for Ca site and oxygen deficiency influence the total thermal conductivity. The figure of merit () is calculated for all the samples. The calculated values are presented in Table 2. The highest ZT (0.047) is reached for Ca0.95Bi0.05MnO3-δ, which represents a 487 % increase when compared with undoped sample (CaMnO3-δ). Ca0.95Bi0.05MnO3-δ exhibits a higher ZT value than the reported values by Xu et al. and by Ohtaki et al.. Xu et al. and Ohtaki et al. have reported that ZT value of ≈ 0.028 at 300 K for the Ca0.96Bi0.04MnO3, ZT value of 0.02 at 300 K for the Ca0.9Bi0.1MnO3, respectively. These results suggest that there is the scope for improvement of n-type materials for high temperature thermoelectric application.
