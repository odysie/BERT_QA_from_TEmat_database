The initial foil manifests the typical characteristic of a semimetal (with the resistivity ρ = 0.0008 Ω cm at room temperature Tr), while the SiC/C composite (curve 2) manifests that typical of a semiconductor with ρ = 3 Ω cm (Tr), Tc ~ 1200 K. Our data allow us to confirm the reliability of the results presented in the previous section. The resistivity of SiC/Si composite at Tr is ~50 Ω cm, Tc ~ 900 K. All mentioned values of ρ are acceptable for classifying the materials under consideration as semiconductors. We did not investigate the optical characteristics of our materials because they have no direct relation to the properties of TR materials.
