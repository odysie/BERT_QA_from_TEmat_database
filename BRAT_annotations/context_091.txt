In Pb1−xAxSe (A: Ti, V, Nb, and Mo) and Pb1−xCrxSe system [], the increased Seebeck coefficient due to increased m* has been observed. The carrier concentration dependence of the Seebeck coefficient is shown in b. The experimental data in this work and literature results are both included. To evaluate the contribution of increased m* to the Seebeck coefficient, a two-band Kane (TBK) model [,] is used to fit the data. All the transition metal Ti-, V-, Cr-, Nb-, and Mo-doped and ⅢA element B-, Ga-, and In-doped n-type PbSe fell onto the fitting line with effective mass m* = 0.5 me, which is higher than that of the Cl- and Br-doped PbSe (m* = 0.27 me). The reason is that CBM is dominated by A-site cations' orbitals and doping at B sites cannot modulate its shape. The increased m* results in the increased S at the same electron concentration. However, different from the constant Seebeck coefficient due to the resonant level in Al-doped PbSe, the Seebeck coefficient of transition metal-doped PbSe shows a variable value with changing electron concentration. Because of the increased S, a high power factor at room temperature is achieved. The highest room temperature power factor is 3300 μW/m/K2 in 1% Mo-doped PbSe, which is 130% higher than that of the Cl-doped sample []. The largely improved PF because of the increased m* will result in high ZT values (as shown in d). The highest room temperature ZT is ∼0.5 in 1% Mo-doped PbSe and the highest peak ZT is ∼1.0 for 0.5% Cr-doped PbSe at about 673 K. Compared with In-doped PbSe samples, transition metal doping can largely increase the power factor and ZT value at low temperatures, resulting in a high average ZT value and conversion efficiency.
