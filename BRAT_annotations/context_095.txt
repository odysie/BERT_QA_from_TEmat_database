In conclusion, multi-scale hierarchical nonstoichiometric TiO1.76 has been successfully fabricated via HPHT reactive sintering in assistance with the use of coarse Ti powder and nanosized TiO2 powder to enhance their thermoelectric performance. Ubiquitous lattice defects engineering in our samples is another achievement. The power factors of TiO1.76 and TiO1.80 reach up to 5.43 and 5.63 μW cm−1 K−2 at 700 °C, respectively; furthermore, the thermal conductivity of our samples is reduced to 1.60 W m−1 K−1 at 700 °C for TiO1.76, and a high dimensionless figure of merit up to 0.33 is obtained at 700 °C in TiO1.76. It was demonstrated here that HPHT is also valid for the fabrication of titanium dioxide based thermoelectric materials. Through the combination of the appropriate ratio of coarse Ti to fine TiO2 and suitable HPHT conditions, we can easily obtain the desirable microstructure to achieve the promotion of thermoelectric performance. Thus, the strategy of reducing the thermal conductivity via rational engineering of multi-scale hierarchical structure and lattice defects, being conducted by HPHT, has great potential to achieve high-performance oxide thermoelectric materials.
