In this paper, we develop a strategy to effectively tune the carrier concentration without disrupting the hybrid superlattice structure. A giant high power factor (904 µW m-1 K-2) is obtained for the flexible n-type material at room temperature, which is even close to that of some high-ZT inorganic materials, such as SnSe (1010 µW m-1 K-2 @ 850 K) and Cu2-xSe (1200 µW m-1 K-2@ 1000 K).
