The power factor (PF) is shown in e and f for the two approximations of the relaxation time. For the non-substituted compound TlInSe2 with constant τ the PF increases linearly. The SO coupling has no effect on the PF. A broad maximum is observed when taking the T-dependence of electron-phonon scattering into account. The maximum PF of 3.22 × 10−4 W/m-K2 is reached at 580 K. This value is comparable to the PF of state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials. For example, the PF of Cu2Se reaches a maximum of 1.3 × 10−3 W/m-K2 at T = 1000 K, SnSe along the crystallographic b-axis has a PF = 1.0 × 10−3 W/m-K2. In Li-substituted Tl0·5Li0·5InSe2 the PF only reaches a maximum of 1.93 × 10−4 W/m-K2 (2.62 × 10−4) at 230 K (250 K) for calculations with SO (WSO) coupling (f). This reduction in the PF demonstrates that the electronic properties of Tl0·5Li0·5InSe2 are less favorable with regard to thermoelectric applications. Hence, Li-substitution turns out not to be a suitable optimization strategy in terms of improving the electronic materials properties.
