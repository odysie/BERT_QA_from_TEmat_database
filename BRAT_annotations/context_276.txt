Bismuth antimony telluride (BixSb2−xTe3, 0.4 < x< 0.6) is one of the most commonly used p-type TE materials near room temperature. It has been frequently reported to have a zT higher than one at room temperature. In 2008, Ren's group successfully made nanostructured bismuth antimony tellurium alloys prepared by SPS, and a peak zT of 1.3 in the temperature range of 348 and 373 K was achieved. Later, Xie et al. prepared Bi–Sb–Te samples with nano-domains and coherent boundaries using melt spinning technique together with SPS resulting in a significant improvement of zT to a value of 1.5 at 390 K. In 2015, Kim et al. introduced dense dislocation arrays embedded in grain boundaries which effectively reduced the lattice thermal conductivity and an enhancement of zT up to 1.86 at 320 K was achieved.
