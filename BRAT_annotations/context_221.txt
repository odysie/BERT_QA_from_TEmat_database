Heavily reduced titania TiO1.1–1.2 (processed by controlled combustion synthesis from metallic titanium with sodium perchlorate, etc., and densified by spark plasma sintering) was reported to reach exceptional figures of merit of 1.2–1.64 at temperature of 700–1,200 °C, but these results were not confirmed by the scientific community, including our own work.
