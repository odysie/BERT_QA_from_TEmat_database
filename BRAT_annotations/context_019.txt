 we have compiled literature data for the Hall mobility vs. carrier concentration for similar compositions of Mg2X (X = Sn, Si). Tang et al. obtained carrier concentrations in the optimum range for their Li-doped samples, but the carrier mobility is low compared to our findings probably due to the different sample synthesis methods . For the optimized samples Zhang et al. and Tang et al. reported similar mobilities in Mg2(1-x)Li2xSn0.7Si0.3 and Mg2(1-x)Li2xSn0.6Si0.4, respectively. For carrier concentrations above 1 × 10^20 cm−3, where the optimized carrier concentration is expected, the mobilities for all the Li doped Mg2Sn0.75Ge0.25 are higher compared to the previous reports, which results in a peak power factor of 18 μW cm−1 K−2 at 723 K for Mg1.96Li0.04Sn0.75Ge0.25. The high power factor is partially due to the high Sn content in the samples and furthermore due to the use of Ge instead of Si. Recently, de Boor and Saparamadu et al. used the same synthesis technique to compare the properties of Li doped Mg2(Sn,Si) and Mg2(Sn,Ge) . They found the mobilities of Li doped Mg2(Sn,Ge) samples are higher compared to the Mg2(Sn,Ge) samples, in agreement with the findings for the n-type Mg2X (X = Sn, Si, Ge) . Applying a single parabolic band model with scattering by acoustic phonons as scattering mechanism the mobility (μph) can be expressed as,
