According to the measured electrical resistivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity, the temperature dependence of ZT was calculated and plotted in the Fig. 5. Owing to optimized carrier concentration and decreased Îº by point defects, the nominal composition Cu1.95Pb0.015Se exhibits the highest ZT value of 1.52 at 973 K. The reduction of thermal conductivity by Pb doping is not ideal or enough, but the ZT value is higher than reports with doping elements Fe, In, Mn, and Sm under the same temperature, and is comparable to that doped with Hg or Ni in Cu2Se. While, the ZT value of 1.52 is lower than some reported record values, which are optimized and obtained by nano engineering or energy band engineering.
