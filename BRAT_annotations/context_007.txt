The resulting temperature dependence of the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) is shown in d. In comparison with the control samples, the Fe/Cu-containing samples exhibited a marked 50% improvement in ZT. The small increase in thermal conductivity brought about by the presence of the inclusions was not sufficient to reduce the power factor to any degree. Indeed, the effect of reduced electrical resistivity dominated, enabling improved power factor and hence, ZT in samples containing metal inclusions. At temperatures up to 900 K the figure of merit for the Cu-containing samples was higher than for other samples, with a maximum ZT of 0.36. The Fe-containing samples displayed an almost linear dependence of ZT with temperature, with a highest ZT of 0.38 at 1000 K. These values show considerable improvement in the figure of merit compared to control sample and verifies the benefit of employing small metallic inclusions in perovskite thermoelectric ceramics. Once realistic uncertainties in ZT are taken into account (at least ±10%) the highest values here (0.38) are comparable with many of the best values reported for SrTiO3-based ceramics using alternative approaches. For example, Lin et al. achieved a ZT of 0.38 at 1000 K for La doped STO assisted with inclusion of graphene. Zhang et al. reported a ZT of 0.37 at 1000 K for SrTi0.85Nb0.15O3 and Lu et al. obtained a ZT of 0.40 for A-site deficient La doped STO (La0.2Sr0.7TiO3); Dy doping of STO yielded a ZT of 0.41 at 1073 K . Again all these values are within the same significance bands. It is interesting to note that while the ZT values for the ceramics are lower than those for the single crystal data at low temperatures, the ZT values for the ceramics are consistently higher at the higher temperatures.
