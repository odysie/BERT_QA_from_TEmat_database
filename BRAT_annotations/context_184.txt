β-Ag2Se is a narrow band semiconductor with an energy gap Eg = 0.07 eV at 0 K and it transforms into a cubic superionic conductor (α-Ag2Se) around 407 K. β-Ag2Se, which exhibits high electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity, has the great potential for n-type TE material near room temperature. Several groups have reported the TE performance of Ag2Se. For instance, Ferhat et al. prepared β-Ag2Se bulks by a direct-reaction of the element Ag and Se in evacuated quartz tubes at 1273 K and the maximum power factor of the material was about 3500 μW m-1 K-2, which is similar to that of the state-of-art material at room temperature. Most recently, Perez-Taborda et al. deposited Ag2Se films on glass substrates via pulsed hybrid reactive magnetron sputtering and the films showing a high power factor ~2440 μWm-1 K-2 at room temperature. Nevertheless, the films are with relatively high cost since an expensive facility is used.
