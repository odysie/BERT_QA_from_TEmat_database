In this paper, we have presented first-principles study of elastic, electronic, thermodynamic and thermoelectric transport properties of TaCoSn by using density functional theory (DFT) and semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. We have calculated elastic constants and moduli of elasticity, anisotropy, Vickers hardness. We also calculate the Debye temperature of TaCoSn which found to be 375.39 K. The calculated band structure of TaCoSn confirms the semiconducting nature and the possibility of high thermoelectric performance. The relaxation time and lattice thermal conductivity have been calculated for TaCoSn. The maximum Seebeck coefficient is obtained at 500 K, 249.41 μV/K and power factor (S2σ) of TaCoSn is 2.22 × 10^12 W/msK2 at 1000 K. The calculated maximum thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) is found to be 0.731 at 600 K indicating that TaCoSn is a high performance thermoelectric material.
