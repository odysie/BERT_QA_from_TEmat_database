The pure SiC has a Seebeck coefficient of 670 ± 33 μV/K at 373 K and shows p-type behavior as the Seebeck coefficient is positive which is consistent with the value of additive-free SiC in the literature . As discussed above, TiCN has a negative and low Seebeck coefficient instead. Interestingly, similarly to the case of the segregated network in SiAlON, the overall electrical properties of the material are dominated by TiCN which causes the composite to exhibit n-type conductivity and lower Seebeck coefficient. It is worth noting that increasing the amount of TiCN (from 5 to 10 vol.%) does not significantly affect the Seebeck coefficient values. Although the electrical conductivity increases with the addition of TiCN to the system, due to the overall lower Seebeck coefficient values than pure SiC matrix, the PF of the composite is lower than the one of the matrix alone ((e)). One should note that if the amount of TiCN is below 5 vol.% only a partially connecting network might be obtained instead of a percolating one. The lower amount of TiCN results in higher resistivity and, as the TiCN amount does not have significant effects on the Seebeck coefficient, an improved thermoelectric performance cannot be obtained.
