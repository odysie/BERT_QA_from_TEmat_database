In this work, to explore the influences of Hf/Sb co-doping, we substituted Zr sites with various Hf doping contents and co-doping Sb at Sn site in ZrNiSn, and systematically investigated the electronic structures and transport properties of HfxZr1-xNiSn1-ySby (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5; y = 0, 0.02) by using the first-principles calculations and semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. Our calculation results show that 50% Hf doping in ZrNiSn simultaneously increases the degeneracy (Nv) at the bottom of conduction band (CB) and the dispersion of energy-band near the CB edge, which are helpful to increasing S and slightly enhanceing σ. Meanwhile, we elucidate that why 2% Sb co-doping further largely improves σ. It increases total density of states near the Fermi energy (EF) and leads to the convergence of the light and heavy bands and valley degeneracy. Nv reaches eleven at the Γ point of the bottom of conduction band. Besides, our work also demonstrates that Hf0.5Zr0.5NiSn0.98Sb0.02still maintains high μ in spite of mb⁎ increasing. Therefore, a great improvement in σ occurs. The ZT (~1.37) of Hf0.5Zr0.5NiSn0.98Sb0.02 with the n of 7.56 × 10^18 cm-3 at 1000 K is predicted.
