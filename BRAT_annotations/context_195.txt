To evaluate the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of the SWNT film and CoCp2@SWNT film, we determined the thermal conductivity (κ) using the following equation (3), . where Cp, α and ρ are the specific heat capacity, thermal diffusivity and density, respectively and these numerical values are listed in Table S2. Interestingly, both films were found to possess much lower κ values (0.12 and 0.15 W m-1 K-1 for the SWNT film and CoCp2@SWNT film, respectively) than the reported value of an individual SWNT (3500 W m-1 K-1). Instead, the obtained value was comparable to the reported random network SWNT films (0.1–0.2 W m-1 K-1). Such a low thermal conductivity would be derived from the huge interfacial thermal resistance (phonon-phonon Umklapp scattering) and their low density of the films (0.6–0.8 g cm-3, see Fig. 3b). Based on the result, we determined the ZT values using the following equation (4), . where S, σ and T are the Seebeck coefficient (V K-1), electric conductivity (S m-1) and absolute temperature (K), respectively. The ZT value of the CoCp2@SWNT film (0.157 at 320 K) was much higher than that of the SWNT film (0.025) due to its higher electrical conductivity than that of the SWNT film (Fig. 3e). Notably, the value was almost two times higher than that of the reported n-type CNT-based materials and the highest among the reported n-type organic thermoelectric materials (see Supplementary, Table S3).
