Experimental data for NbO (made from sintered, oxidized niobium powder) showed very small thermoelectric power (10–15 μV/K at 1,000 K) and electrical conductivity below 1 S/m (1,000 K). Seebeck coefficients of -100 to -200 μV/K (widely independent of stoichiometry) at electrical conductivity of 100–20,000 S/m were reported for NbO2; the best power factors (2 × 10^-4 W/mK2 0.1. The same authors reported Seebeck coefficients ranging from -100 to -500 μV/K (1,000 K) for Nb2O5 with highest values close to the 2:5 stoichiometry. A similar set of data projected slightly lower electrical conductivities. Most of the reported materials were made from coarse powders by natural sintering; even though information on grain size and density is lacking, the large differences in electrical conductivities suggest that the grain boundaries in those materials acted as strong barriers for transport (impurity segregation, intergranular glass, space charge layers or…).
