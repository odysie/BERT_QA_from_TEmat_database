In this work, we prepared Pb1−xMgxTe0.8Se0.2 solid solutions with the optimized Na doping. The PbTe0.8Se0.2 was adopted as the matrix due to a zT of ∼1.8 obtained in previous work . The effects of Mg alloying on the TE performance of PbTe0.8Se0.2 were systematically investigated. It is found that the power factor is increased by 15% and the lattice thermal conductivity is reduced by 20% at 800 K. A maximum zT of ∼2.2 is obtained at 820 K for the sample of Mg0.08Pb0.92Te0.8Se0.2 with 2% Na doping. Furthermore, the sample was magnified up to ∼200 g in weight. In order to check the repeatability and the composition homogeneity in large-size sample, small platelets (Φ12.7 mm × 2 mm) were cut from different parts of the large bulk and their TE properties were measured. It is shown that the average zTs reach ∼2.0.
