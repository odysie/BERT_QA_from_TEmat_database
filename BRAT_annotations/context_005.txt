). The result illustrates a jump of carriers above 573 K. Specifically, the Seebeck coefficient of Cu2Sn0.93Ag0.07Se3 reaches +145 μVK−1 at 773 K, which is 15 μVK−1 larger than the linear extrapolating value (shown as the red dashed line). d illustrates that the PFs of all doped samples are enhanced owing to the optimized carrier concentrations. Moreover, benefitting from the increased carrier concentrations and the sharp increase of Seebeck coefficients at elevated temperatures, the PFs for 5%, 7%, and 9% Ag-doped samples are improved continuously across the whole temperature range. A record high PF of 12.9 μWcm−1K−2 is achieved in Cu2Sn0.93Ag0.07Se3 at 773 K, which increases significantly by ∼220% from that of the undoped Cu2SnSe3.
