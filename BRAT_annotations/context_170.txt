The thermal conductivity of all samples decreases with increasing temperature, and it also decreases with increasing Ag, which indicates the enhanced phonon scattering by point defects or the Ag2Se inclusions. At room temperature, the thermal conductivity of SnSe is ~1.5 W m-1 K, which is consistent with previously reported values in HP and SPS samples. The lowest thermal conductivity is observed to be ~0.5 W m-1 K at 793 K in Sn0.98Ag0.04Se. The ZT values are calculated from the measured properties and are plotted in Figure 3d. Due to better electrical properties, Sn0.99Ag0.02Se shows higher ZT values than Sn0.98Ag0.04Se and undoped SnSe. The highest ZT in Sn0.99Ag0.02Se is found to be over 0.9 at 793 K, which is higher than the reported values in polycrystalline SnSe materials.,,,, However, this value is still smaller than that of the Ag-doped SnSe SC (1.2).
