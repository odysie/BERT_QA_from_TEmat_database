Conventionally, p-type Si-Ge alloys have been used as building blocks in TE cells, exhibiting ZT900 K). Several new structures and materials have also been explored recently. For example, Yb14MnSb11 has revealed a promising increase of both ZT (185 µV/K at 1275 K) and Seebeck’s coefficient (S) (1.0 at 1275 K), the latter having twice the value obtained from Si-Ge alloys. By reducing the thermal conductivity and optimizing carrier concentration in bulk materials, the above approaches have demonstrated high ZT of 1.25—at high temperatures around 900 K—and maximum S of 200 μV/K. Following this approach, Ba8Ga16Ge30 alloy has been shown to have ZT of 1.35 at 900 K, and an extrapolated ZT up to 1.63 at 1100 K is predicted, with S of 45 and 300 μV/K measured at 300 and 900 K, respectively. Both, p- and n-type semiconductor materials with different structures have been investigated for high-temperature TE applications. The p-type TE materials have shown promising results (e.g. p-type Bi2Te3/Sb2Te3 superlattices exhibiting a ZT of 2.4 at 300 K and S of 243 μV/K) compared to n-type (e.g. n-type Bi2Te3/Bi2Te2.83Se0.17 showing a ZT below 1.4 at 300 K). Chalcogenide compounds such as Cs1-xRbxBi4Te, have also been used as TE materials for near-/mid-room-temperature applications, e.g. showing a ZT above 1.5 and a S of 100 μV/K at low temperatures around 160 K. Despite excellent advances the performance of above bulk and thin film materials falls short of the requirements for wider nano- and micro-electronic systems.
