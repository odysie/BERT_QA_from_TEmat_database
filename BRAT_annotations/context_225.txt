Sub-stoichiometric Nb2O5-x, NbO2 and Nb12O29 pure-phase materials were obtained by disproportion reaction followed by slow natural sintering or rapid current-assisted reactive sintering; the Nb47O116 composition showed an Nb2O5-x-type-related structure. Figure 14 shows typical microstructures of the materials. The thermoelectric performance of the sub-stoichiometric phases and their mixtures are shown in Fig. 15. Compositions with Nb2O5-type structures clustered in one group with low electrical conductivity (<5,000 S/m at 1,000 K) with negative temperature dependency and a moderate Seebeck coefficient (-150 to -300 μV/K at 1,000 K) that improved with temperature. Compositions in the range from Nb12O29 to NbO2+x formed a second group of materials with semiconductor-type electrical conductivity and reached about 30,000 S/m at 1,000 K with smaller Seebeck coefficients around -100 μV/K at 1,000 K. Both material groups showed the same low lattice thermal conductivity of about 2 W/mK2 at high temperature, but differed at low temperature. The Nb12O29 group adopted higher lattice conductivity, while Nb2O5-type materials demonstrated temperature-independent lattice conductivity. The figure of merit of the Nb12O29-based materials was higher and reached ZT(1,000 K) = 0.16, Fig. 15.
