To validate our calculations, we also computed the thermoelectric properties for a well studied p-type HH compound FeNbSb, for which a PF as large as 10.6 mW m-1 K-2 was recently measured at room temperature. Figure 5c shows that our calculation considering electron–phonon coupling predicts a maximum PF of 11.7 mW m-1 K-2 for FeNbSb at 300 K, representing the upper limit without considering other scattering sources such as defects and grain boundaries. Our calculated S, σ, and PF of FeNbSb at optimized carrier concentration and temperatures from 200 to 500 K also compare well with a recent theoretical study that employs the same methodology. The good agreement between our calculations and experimental data confirms our assumption that electron–phonon coupling dominates carrier scattering in this system. It is noteworthy that the optimal PF of FeNbSb is significantly higher than that of PbTe at 300 K,.
