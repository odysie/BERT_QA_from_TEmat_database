 shows that the lattice thermal conductivities of pristine PbS (the blue solid line in the figure) can be significantly reduced by solid solution point defect scattering alone (given for n-type and p-type variants respectively as the dotted and solid brown lines in the figure), where the room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity of pristine PbS is reduced by ∼40% in the case of p-type Pb0.975Na0.025S and 10% for n-type PbS0.98Cl0.02, respectively. Subsequent research has demonstrated that nanostructuring with Bi2S3 (given as the dotted green line in a) results in an additional ∼30% reduction of the lattice thermal conductivity for n-type PbS0.98Cl0.02. Further introduction of mesostructures (given for n-type and p-type variants respectively as the dotted and solid red lines in a) led to an additional suppression of lattice thermal conductivity by ∼40% and ∼25% for p-type Pb0.975Na0.025S-SrS and n-type PbS0.98Cl0.02-Bi2S3, respectively. Overall, these efforts increased the ZT values to ∼1.2 and ∼1.1 at 923 K for p-type Pb0.975Na0.025S-3%SrS and n-type PbS0.98Cl0.02–1% Bi2S3, respectively, as depicted in b.
