a, Seebeck coefficient enhancements at room temperature can only be observed in binary SnTe at high Hall carrier concentrations of nH > ∼ 2 × 10^20 cm−3, with a maximum appears at nH ∼ 8 × 10^20 cm−3. Due to the band convergence effect induced by alloying with MnTe as evidenced from our DFT calculations, it is clearly shown that a higher MnTe concentration leads to a stronger Seebeck coefficient enhancement. This result provides a clear evolution on solid solution reducing the band offset in SnTe, and shows a good agreement with the above mentioned temperature dependent Hall coefficient measurements (a). Furthermore, when back dope the Sn0.85Mn0.15Te solid solution with iodine to obtain different carrier concentrations , all the resulting materials show a Seebeck coefficient well above the Pisarenko line (Hall carrier concentration dependent Seebek coefficient) that predicted based on a two band model . More quantitatively, the obtained room temperature Seebeck coefficient of ∼60 μV/K in Sn0.85Mn0.15Te alloys, is about four times increased as compared with SnTe (∼15 μV/K). a also shows a detailed comparison on the Seebeck coefficient with available literatures in SnTe solid solution with band convergence effect. It is shown the Seebeck coefficient enhancement obtained in Sn0.85Mn0.15Te is much more significant than any other ever reported, suggesting a better band alignment that can be expected from the higher solubility of MnTe (∼15%). This band convergence resulted Seebeck coefficient enhancement persists to higher temperatures as shown in b.
