From last decades, the significant advances achieved in the synthesis of high-quality nanostructures with excellent control over their properties, as well as the development of highly-controlled integration techniques, have allowed us to use micro- and nano-structures as building blocks in TE generators. For small temperature gradients (i.e. < 20 K), the nanostructures are likely to have better ZT compared to their counterpart based on the bulk and thin film materials. This makes them promising candidates as energy harvesters for self-powered wearable systems on flexible substrates. The NWs-based superlattices, InSb quantum-dot structures, Si NWs, single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) bundle, BiTe NWs and a GaAs NWs, are predicted to have better thermoelectric properties than bulk and thin film materials. For example, ZT values greater than 4 and 6 are predicted for 5-nm diameter PbSe/PbS and PbTe/PbSe superlattice NWs at 77 K. Alternatively, tubular nanostructures such as nanotubes (NTs), have also demonstrated a great potential as TE materials. For example Bi2T3 NTs have exhibit S about 160 Î¼V/K at 300 K, which is higher than those observed in Bi2Te3 NWs.
