 between 340 K and 523 K. Measurements were performed in both parallel and perpendicular to the pressing direction, except for x = 0 sample, for which only the perpendicular direction could be measured. For all samples and directions, the electrical resistivity exhibits typical metallic temperature dependence behaviour, indicative of the degenerate semiconducting nature of the samples. Despite moderate structural anisotropy observed from the XRD patterns, ρ shows a significant anisotropy for all compounds, with values of ρperp/ρpar ranging from 1.5 to 2.5, which is well known for n-type bismuth telluride alloys . The change in anisotropy with x values can mostly be understood in light of the Cr atoms filling the VdW gaps, which increases the distance between the five plane layers. However, the presence of precipitates and their alignment along the grain boundaries, as evidenced in , may also contribute to the anisotropy observed in the electronic transport properties of these samples. This results in a more pronounced confinement of the electronic transport within the layers in the a crystallographic direction; hence, more contrast is detected in the electrical conduction properties between the two directions. This effect is more apparent for the x = 0.05 sample, for which Cr intercalation is expected to be maximum in the series. Electrical resistivity, ρ, initially increases upon Cr substitution from 8.9 μΩ m at 350 K for the nominal compound up to 11.6 μΩ m for Bi1.99Cr0.01Te3. The electrical resistivity then decreases for all compounds to 7.8 μΩ m for the x = 0.1 composite sample. The low resistivity for this sample might originate from the presence of the Cr–Te secondary phase, leading to the off-stoichiometry of the matrix Bi2Te3 phase.
