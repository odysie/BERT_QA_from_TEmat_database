. In addition, the obtained ZnSb product exhibited high and stable electrical properties (power factor, 1.2·10−3 W/m K2) in the temperature range of 300 to 700 K (b). It is noteworthy that this value is very close to that of Zn4Sb3 (0.7–1.2·10−3 W/m K2) [], which is the best TE material so far in the Zn-Sb system. Besides, Ge et al. used the BM-SPS method to fabricate a Bi2Te3 TE material with ultra-low lattice thermal conductivity (0.2 Wm−1 K−1 at 373 K) and high figure of merit (ZT) (0.7 at 398 K) []. Similar investigations on BM-SPSed TE materials such as SrTiO3:15 at.% Nb [], (Bi0.25Sb0.75)2Te3 [], and Bi doped Mg2Si [], reported excellent properties.
