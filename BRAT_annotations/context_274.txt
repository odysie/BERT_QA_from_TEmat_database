The thermal conductivity of the pure CaMnO3 film is measured to 2.2 W m−1 K−1 at room temperature, whereas the CaMn1−xNbxO3 films decrease the thermal conductivity from 1.9 W m−1 K−1 to 1.6 W m−1 K−1 with the increase of Nb content. These thermal conductivity values are lower compared to most other reported values. The low thermal conductivity of our thin film is attributed to the grain boundary scattering of phonons, as due to the low grain size (40 nm) of the films, and a R–P secondary phase in the films.
