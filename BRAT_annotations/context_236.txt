where Fn(η) is the n-th order Fermi integral, kB is the Boltzmann constant, e is the electron charge, h is the Planck constant and r is the scattering factor. Usually, this calculation is assumed based on a single parabolic band with three-dimensional transport character. In this study, BiCuSeO polycrystalline samples were examined at a random grain orientation because it is difficult to extract the directional dependence of the physical properties for a polycrystalline sample. Therefore, all values provided in this paper are averaged estimates. The scattering factor (r) is -1/2 as the acoustic phonon scattering is independent of the grain size and is generally assumed to be the main scattering mechanism at room temperature. The reduced Fermi energy η was determined based on the fitting of respective Seebeck values (the details are provided in the SI). The calculation provides an effective mass (m*) of ~0.60 mo, which is consistent with 0.54 mo determined by density of state calculations and higher than that of PbTe (0.24 mo) and PbS (0.40 mo) with a rock salt structure. The combined electrical conductivity and positive temperature-dependent Seebeck coefficient result in a power factor (S2σ) peak at a high temperature of 923 K. As shown in Figure 5c, the highest power factor is ~4.74 μW cm-1 K-2 for the Bi0.925Ca0.075CuSeO sample at 923 K, which is higher than ~4.10 μW cm-1 K-2 at 923 K for the BiCu0.975SeO sample.
