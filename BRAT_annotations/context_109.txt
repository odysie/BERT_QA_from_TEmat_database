As shown in (c), the Seebeck coefficient of all samples was positive over the entire temperature range, indicating that holes are the majority carriers of the samples. All samples exhibited a similar trend with the Seebeck coefficient increasing significantly as temperature increased. Maximum value of the Seebeck coefficient was 136 µVK−1 with 0.04 wt% rGO at 859 K. Power factor ((d)) of Na1.2Co1.8Ag0.2O4/rGO was higher than Na1.2Co1.8Ag0.2O4 with maximum power factor of 444 μW m−1 K−2 at 0.04 wt% rGO and 859 K.
