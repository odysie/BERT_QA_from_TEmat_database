In summary, PSVA method was introduced into the preparation of PEDOT:PSS films with solvents such as DMSO, EG, DMF, NMP and H2O to improve the thermoelectric performance. The electrical conductivity of PSVA-treated PEDOT:PSS films was significantly enhanced, and the maximum value was up to 496 S cm-1 (treated with EG). Especially, utilizing the PSVA method, H2O could also remarkably enhance the electrical conductivity of pristine PEDOT:PSS film from 0.2 to 57 S cm-1. However, there was no distinct change for the Seebeck coefficient of PSVA-treated films with the significantly enhanced electrical conductivity. The PSVA-treated PEDOT:PSS films exhibited improved thermoelectric performance and the maximum a power factor was up to 9.47 Î¼W m-1 K-2 (treated with DMSO) at room temperature. The improved thermoelectric performance might be attributed to the PSS loss from the PEDOT:PSS films and the conformational change of the PEDOT chains. These changes resulted into the simultaneous increase of carrier mobility and carrier concentration. All these results demonstrated that PSVA method might be an effective method to improve the thermoelectric performance of PEDOT:PSS films.
