The temperature dependent electrical conductivity (σ) of all the synthesized samples are presented in (c), which suggests that the σ of all the doped samples are higher than that for the pristine CoSb3 [] in the whole temperature range, which may be attributed to the high n and μ of the doped samples (). However, all the doped samples behave like degenerate semiconductor as the σ decreases with temperature due to enhanced impurity scattering of charge carriers resulting a fall in the σ with the rising temperature. This slight degenerate semiconducting nature has also been confirmed by the calculations of room temperature fermi energy as explained earlier. Among all the synthesized samples, the sample with composition Fe0.25Co0.75Sb2.99Bi0.01 turn out to be the most electrically conducting with RT σ ~10 × 10^4 S/m which is higher than the previously reported values for similarly co-doped CoSb3 []. At elevated temperature, the σ of the corresponding sample reduced to ~9 × 10^4 S/m due to boost in charge carriers scattering. displays the theoretically calculated temperature dependent σ for Fe and Bi co-doped CoSb3 with different values of n, which suggest that the σ decreases with temperature confirming the degenerate semiconducting nature, similar to that observed experimentally. Also, these values are in reasonable agreement with the experimentally measured values of σ. Further, It is also evident from , that expectedly S decreases while σ increases with increasing n, following the mathematical relation between n and the transport properties [].
