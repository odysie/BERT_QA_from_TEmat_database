Besides the CPs, insulating polymers are also employed for forming TE composites with inorganic TE materials. For example, most recently, Hou et al. prepared p-type Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 and epoxy resin composite thick film by hot-pressing (623 K, 4 MPa) and the film shows a high power factor (PF = α2σ) of 840 μW m-1 K-2. Recently, flexible substrate, such as polyimide, fiber or paper, has been used to support inorganic materials for preparing high performance and flexible TE materials. For instance, Gao et al. reported a glass-fiber-aided cold-pressing method for flexible n-type Ag2Te films on copy paper and the power factor value was up to 85 μW m-1 K-2 at 300 K. Choi et al. prepared n-type HgSe nanocrystal thin film by spin-coating HgSe nanocrystal solution on a plastic substrate and the film showing a maximum power factor of 550 μW m-1 K-2 at 300 K. Jin et al. deposited Bi2Te3 thick film on a cellulose fibers paper via an unbalanced magnetron sputtering technique and the composite film exhibits good flexibility and a power factor of ~250 μW m-1 K-2 at room temperature.
