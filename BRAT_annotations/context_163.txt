a depicts electrical conductivity σ as a function of temperature for different SnSe1–xTex samples. For pristine SnSe, σ firstly increases with increasing temperature, then turns to decrease at ∼450 K but finally increases above 650 K. This trend is also found in previous reports, which can be ascribed to amixed scattering mechanism of carrier transport by acoustic phonon and grain boundary potential barrier [,]. Compared to pure SnSe, the electrical conductivities of Te-doped samples have been greatly enhanced, especially around room temperature. The maximum electrical conductivity of 98.4 S/cm for the sample SnSe0.8Te0.2 is obtained at 300 K. This value is significantly higher than those reported in other polycrystalline SnSe [,,].
