c displays PF of the Bi2Te3 rod and cores at 300–400 K. With applied tensile stress, the PF of samples at 400 K initially increases from 0.82 mW m−1 K−2 for the rod, to 1.0 mW m−1 K−2 for KF, and to 1.35 mW m−1 K−2 for BF. It can be attributed to the better orientation and larger carrier mobility in KF/BF than the rod []. The most interesting finding is that the 600 K-annealed BF core possesses the highest PF of 1.54 mW m−1 K−2 at 400 K. It should be attributed to the enhanced S after annealing for 24 h, because S might increase when the BF core tension was partly eliminated after annealing. Moreover, the annealed BF core has a power factor of 1.32 mW m−1 K−2 and a ZT value of ∼0.76 at 300 K, when the thermal conductivity of the core is estimated being ∼0.52 W m−1 K−1 from our previous 89-μm-diameter Bi2Te3 fiber core []. For checking TE performance of the Bi2Te3 fibers, we prepare a daily paper cup covered with 20 pieces of BF fibers in series via silver electrodes, namely TE fiber cup generator, which can provide μW power under ΔT = 19 K from waste heat of hot water (see in the Supplementary Information). Hence, tuning tensile stress can be used to improve electrical transport in TE fibers and develop TE generators.
