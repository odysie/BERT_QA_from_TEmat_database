 shows some investigations on BiSbTe materials by various nanostructuring methods. Kim et al. developed a liquid-phase-compaction method to form dense dislocation arrays, and obtained a remarkable high ZT value of 1.86 at 320 K for Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3. Poudel et al. obtained a ZT value of 1.4 at 373 K in BiSbTe nanocrystalline bulk by ball-milling and hot pressing from commercial alloy ingot, which resulted from grain boundaries and defects scattering . Similarly, Ma et al. achieved a ZT value of 1.3 at 348–373 K by the same nanostructuring approach with elemental chunks as starting materials . Li et al. reported an improved ZT value of 1.33 at 373 K for Bi0.3Sb1.7Te3 by SiC nanoparticles, which resulted in the reduction of lattice thermal conductivity . BiSbTe3 bulks by Cao et al. via a hydrothermal route and a hot pressing had a high ZT value of 1.47 at 443 K . Xie et al. obtained a ZT value of 1.56 at 300 K when they used a melt spinning/spark plasma sintering technique . In a previous work, we obtained a ZT value of 1.3 at 510 K in Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 bulk through a high-pressure synthesis (at 3.8 GPa) . The enhancement of the ZT value in this work indicates that pressure-quenching could be effective to fabricate the high-performance nanostructured bulk materials.
